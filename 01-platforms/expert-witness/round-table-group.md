## 1. Executive Summary

In the landscape of expert network and consulting platforms, **Round Table Group (RTG)** occupies a distinct, prestigious niche. While platforms like GLG or AlphaSights focus on rapid-fire, hour-long market research calls, Round Table Group is purely dedicated to the high-stakes world of **litigation support** and **expert witness testimony**.

For a consultant, this distinction is critical. Engagement on RTG is not about answering surveys or quick consultations; it is about being retained for legal cases that may last months or years. The financial upside is significantly higher, with hourly rates often exceeding **$500-$1,000/hr**, and retention contracts ensuring long-term revenue.

This guide provides a comprehensive operational blueprint for navigating Round Table Group, understanding its "white-glove" service model, and maximizing your earnings as a distinguished expert witness.

## 2. Platform Overview & History

### 2.1 The Origin Story
Founded in **1994**, Round Table Group was one of the pioneers in the expert witness industry. Its longevity is a testament to its quality.
*   **The Thomson Reuters Era:** In 2010, the firm was acquired by legal giant Thomson Reuters, becoming "Thomson Reuters Expert Witness Services." This period solidified its relationships with top-tier law firms (Am Law 100).
*   **The Founder Buyback (2019):** In a rare industry move, the original founders re-acquired the company in 2019. This strategic pivot marked a return to their "boutique" roots—prioritizing personalized human connection over automated database scraping.

### 2.2 The "White Glove" Difference
Unlike modern "marketplace" platforms (e.g., Upwork, Catalant) where you bid on projects, or algorithmic expert networks (e.g., Guidepoint), RTG operates as a high-end talent agency.
*   **No Public Job Board:** You cannot see open cases.
*   **No Bidding Wars:** You are not competing on price against 50 other consultants.
*   **The Case Manager:** When you are matched, a dedicated Case Manager contacts you. They vet you, prep you, and present you to the law firm. You are a curated selection, not a search result.

## 3. The Registration & Vetting Process

### 3.1 The Barrier to Entry
Registration is free but selective. They are not looking for generalists; they are looking for **credentialed authorities**.
*   **Target Profile:** PhDs, MDs, published authors, former C-level executives, patent holders, and tenured professors.
*   **Years of Experience:** Typically 10+ years in a specific niche is the baseline.

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Registration
1.  **CV Submission:** You submit a detailed Curriculum Vitae (CV). *Tip: This must be a "legal" CV, not a "job hunting" resume. Focus on publications, speaking engagements, patents, and specific technical skills.*
2.  **The Vetting Call:** A researcher may call to verify your expertise. They will ask specific questions about your sub-niche (e.g., "Do you have experience with *specifically* FPGA architecture in medical devices?" not just "electronics").
3.  **Database Indexing:** Your profile is manually tagged with keywords by their research team. This human indexing is superior to AI for complex legal topics because they understand the *context* of your skills.

## 4. Case Matching Logic

Understanding how RTG finds you is key to getting hired.

### 4.1 The "Conflict Check" First
When a law firm approaches RTG, they provide a list of "adverse parties" (who they are suing).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  RTG receives a request: "We need a structural engineer for a bridge failure case."
    2.  RTG Search Team queries their internal database.
    3.  They find YOU.
    4.  **First Contact:** They email/call you with a generic inquiry: *"Do you have expertise in suspension bridge cabling? And do you have any conflicts with [Company X]?"*

### 4.2 The "Blind" Pitch
At this stage, you often don't know the exact case details. You must sell your expertise broadly but confidently.
*   **Critical Success Factor:** Speed. The Search Team is likely contacting 5-10 experts. The first 3 to respond with a clear "Yes, here is why I am the perfect fit" get presented to the client.

## 5. Financials: Rates, Retainers, and Billing

This is the most lucrative aspect of Round Table Group.

### 5.1 Hourly Rate Structure
You set your own rate. RTG does not dictate it.
*   **Junior/Niche Specialist:** $300 - $500/hr
*   **Senior Executive/Professor:** $600 - $900/hr
*   **World-Class Authority:** $1,000 - $1,500/hr

**The "Finder's Fee" Mechanics:**
RTG adds their fee *on top* of your rate.
*   *Example:* You request $600/hr. RTG presents you to the law firm at roughly $850/hr (estimated markup).
*   **Implication:** You do not need to "discount" your rate to pay RTG. The law firm pays the premium for the vetting service.

### 5.2 Retainer Agreements
In litigation, it is standard to request a **retainer** (upfront deposit).
*   **Standard Retainer:** 10 hours of work paid in advance (e.g., $6,000).
*   **Evergreen Retainer:** A clause stating that when the retainer drops below 5 hours, it must be replenished.
*   **RTG's Role:** They will often handle the billing and collection for you, acting as a buffer between you and the law firm. This ensures you get paid even if the case goes badly for the client.

### 5.3 Billing Cycles
*   **Invoicing:** You typically submit timesheets to RTG monthly.
*   **Payment:** RTG pays you once they collect from the law firm. This is "Pay-when-Paid." *Note: Some agreements may offer faster payment terms, but standard is net-30 or net-60 based on the law firm's payment.*

## 6. Litigation Support Services: What You Actually Do

You are not just a "witness." There are multiple roles you can play.

### 6.1 Consulting Expert (Non-Testifying)
*   **Role:** You work behind the scenes to help the lawyers understand the technical details. You review documents, explain industry standards, and help them craft their legal strategy.
*   **Visibility:** Your name is **not** disclosed to the opposing side.
*   **Pressure:** Low. No deposition, no cross-examination.
*   **Volume:** High volume of document review hours.

### 6.2 Testifying Expert
*   **Role:** You write an "Expert Report" expressing your official opinion. You may be deposed (questioned by opposing counsel) and testify in court.
*   **Visibility:** High. Everything you write is discoverable.
*   **Pressure:** Extreme. You must defend your opinion against aggressive questioning.
*   **Rates:** often 25-50% higher than consulting rates for "Testimony Time" (e.g., $600/hr for review, $900/hr for deposition).

### 6.3 Expert Witness Profiling
RTG sometimes needs experts just to help *vet* other experts or provide background on an industry niche to the search team.

| Feature | Round Table Group | Expert Institute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | Boutique / Agency / White-Glove | High-Tech / Database / Volume |
| **Vetting** | Human-centric, deep interviews | AI-assisted, rapid matching |
| **Fees** | Percentage added on top of expert rate | Subscription models + fees |

*   Use **Round Table Group** if you want high-ticket, prestigious cases where you are treated as a partner, not a commodity.

## 8. Success Strategies: The "Gold Tier" Consultant

To thrive on RTG, you must adopt a specific professional persona.

### 8.1 The "Responsive" Metric
The #1 reason experts lose gigs is slowness. Law firms work on tight court deadlines.
*   **Rule:** Respond to RTG emails within **2 hours**. Even a quick "I received this and am checking conflicts" is better than silence.

### 8.2 The "Conflict-Free" CV
Lawyers are paranoid about "Conflict of Interest."
*   **Strategy:** Maintain a clear list of all companies you have consulted for in the past 5 years. When a case comes in, be proactive: *"I have consulted for Google and Apple, but never for Microsoft. I am clear."*

### 8.3 The Perfect "Engagement Letter"
Do not rely solely on the standard contract. Ensure your engagement letter covers:
*   **Cancellation Policy:** If a trial date is cancelled 24 hours prior, you still charge for the blocked day.
*   **Travel Policy:** Business class for flights over 4 hours.
*   **Portal-to-Portal Billing:** You charge for travel time, not just time on site.

## 10. FAQ & Pitfalls

**Q: Can I turn down a case?**
A: Yes. In fact, turning down a case because you don't feel 100% qualified builds trust. RTG prefers you say "No" than say "Yes" and fail the client.

**Q: Does RTG take a cut of my rate?**
A: Generally, no. They markup *your* rate to the client. If you say you want $500, you get $500. However, always clarify this in the initial discussion.

**Pitfall: The "Daubert" Challenge**
If you embellish your credentials, the opposing counsel will find out and try to disqualify you (a "Daubert" motion). This is career suicide for an expert witness. **Never** exaggerate your qualifications on your CV for RTG.

**Pitfall: The "Hired Gun" Label**
If you testify 100% of the time for Plaintiffs (or 100% for Defendants), you lose credibility. Aim for a 60/40 or 70/30 split to show you are objective.
