### Email 3: Common Mistakes (Day 4)

**Subject:** 3 mistakes that keep consultants stuck at low rates

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name | default: "there"}},

After analyzing 100+ Reddit threads and LinkedIn posts, here are the top 3 mistakes:

1. **Not specializing** - "Cybersecurity consultant" pays less than "OT/ICS Security Architect"

2. **Underpricing** - Most consultants charge 30-50% below market rate

3. **Waiting to be "ready"** - Imposter syndrome costs money. Start before you feel ready.

The good news? All of these are fixable.
