I just open-sourced 124 in-depth guides on building a $50K-$100K/month cybersecurity consulting practice.

After months of research across Reddit, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and 50+ platforms, I compiled everything into one free resource.

**What's inside:**

**Platform Deep Dives (27 guides)**

- Expert networks: GLG ($400-$1000/hr), AlphaSights, Guidepoint, Third Bridge
- vCISO platforms: SideChannel ($5K-$20K/month retainers), FRSecure, PivotPoint
- Bug bounty: HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Synack, Immunefi
- Expert witness: Expert Institute, SEAK ($500-$2000/hr testimony rates)
- Web3 audit: Code4rena, Spearbit, OpenZeppelin

**Rate Guides with Real Numbers**

- Expert network rates by platform and experience level
- vCISO retainer structures and scaling strategies
- Pentest pricing models (hourly vs project vs retainer)
- Expert witness billing best practices

**Industry Verticals (23 guides)**
Healthcare, fintech, federal, energy, manufacturing, aerospace, and more

**Income Reality Check**
Based on real data, not hype:

- Year 1 solo: $8K-$20K/month
- Year 2: $25K-$40K/month
- Year 3+: $40K-$60K/month
- $100K/month requires building a firm (top 0.01% solo)
