## r/bugbounty Post

**Title:** I researched income data for bug bounty vs consulting - here's what I found (free guides)

**Body:**

Created a comprehensive resource comparing bug bounty income to other security consulting paths.

Key findings:

- HackerOne top earners: $1M+/year, typical active hunters: $5K-$20K/month
- Bugcrowd: $500K+/year top, $3K-$15K/month typical
- Synack: More stable but lower ceiling ($3K-$10K/month)
- Immunefi (Web3): Highest payouts but most competitive ($10K-$100K/month for top researchers)

Also covers hybrid approaches (consulting + bounty hunting) and when each makes sense.
