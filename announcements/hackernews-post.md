## Show HN Submission

**Title:** Show HN: Security Consulting Income Guide – 124 free guides on building a consulting practice

**URL:** https://github.com/Ahmed-AdelB/security-consulting-income-guide

**Text (optional, for text post):**

I compiled months of research on security consulting income into an open-source guide.

Covers:

- Expert networks (GLG, AlphaSights, Guidepoint) - $250-$1000/hr
- vCISO platforms (SideChannel, FRSecure) - $5K-$25K/month retainers
- Bug bounty (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Immunefi) - realistic income ranges
- Expert witness work - $500-$2000/hr testimony rates
- 29 security domains (DFIR, GRC, pentest, cloud, etc.)
- 23 industry verticals

Also includes an honest "income reality check" based on Reddit/LinkedIn/Glassdoor data - $100K/month solo is extremely rare (top 0.01%), most achieve it by building a firm.
