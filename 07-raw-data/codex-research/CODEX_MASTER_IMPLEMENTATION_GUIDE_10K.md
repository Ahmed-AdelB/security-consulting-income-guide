## 7. The Golden Rules of $100K/Month

1.  **The 3-Hour Rule:** Respond to Expert Network invites within 3 hours. Speed = Selection.
2.  **Always Negotiate:** Never accept the default rate after your first 5 calls. "My standard rate is now $X."
3.  **Retainers > Hours:** Never do hourly consulting for clients directly. Sell monthly outcomes (Retainers). Hourly is only for Expert Networks/Witness.
4.  **Cross-Pollinate:** Use Expert Network insights to impress vCISO clients. Use vCISO "war stories" to win Expert Witness cases.
5.  **No Free Work:** Discovery calls are 15 mins. Anything more is a paid assessment.

---

## 8. Weekly Maintenance Checklist

*   **Monday:** Check all Expert Network dashboards. Apply to 5 new relevant projects.
*   **Tuesday:** vCISO Client work / Board Meetings.
*   **Wednesday:** Deep Work (Web3 Audit or Content Creation).
*   **Thursday:** Business Development (Follow up on proposals, network with MSPs).
*   **Friday:** Administrative (Invoicing, Scheduling next week).
