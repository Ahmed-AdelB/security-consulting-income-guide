## Blind-Sourced Signals (Internal References Only)
These quotes are **Blind-sourced anecdotes** embedded in existing research files. They indicate compensation patterns but **do not represent statistically validated salary bands**.

| Theme | Blind-Sourced Anecdote (Internal) | Compensation Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expert network rates | “I charge **$250/hr** (the highest they seem to let you go).” | Indicates upper bound for 1:1 expert calls in certain networks. |
| High-end expert consulting | “GLG Council Member status gets you **$800/hr** for specialized compliance knowledge.” | Specialized compliance expertise can command premium hourly rates. |
| Supplemental income | “Made **$2,500/month** on Bugcrowd while working full-time CISO job.” | Bug bounty can be meaningful side income but is not a base salary proxy. |
| Fractional CISO equity | “Fractional CISO for 3 startups. **$120k/year base** + **$500k+ equity** on exit.” | Equity can dominate TC for leadership roles, especially with startup exits. |

## Research Gaps & Next Steps (Blind-Specific)
Because Blind data is not accessible here, the following steps are needed for a true Blind-centric comp dataset:

1. **Capture 100-200 Blind posts** across target companies and levels (security engineer, AppSec, CISO, consultant).
2. **Normalize TC format** (base + bonus + RSU annualized, location, year).
3. **Tag for location & level** to avoid mixing L4/L6 or SF/remote data.
4. **Cross-check outliers** with Levels.fyi and Glassdoor ranges for sanity.
5. **Build medians by role & company** to avoid skew from single high-variance posts.

---

## Final Notes
This report is **as Blind-focused as possible using only local data**. For an authentic Blind dataset, direct platform access (or a user-provided export) is required to validate compensation ranges and establish medians by role, level, and location.
