## 5) Evaluation Criteria and Scoring

Score each competitor 1–5 to identify comparative strengths.

**Service depth**
- Breadth of services across governance, technical testing, response, and ongoing management.

**Specialization**
- Domain expertise in specific industries or regulatory regimes.

**Delivery quality**
- Repeatable methodology, reporting quality, and remediation support.

**Credibility**
- Certifications, published research, speaking engagements, and references.

**Client experience**
- Responsiveness, clarity, and ease of engagement.

**Value/pricing**
- Price-to-outcome ratio; flexible engagement models.

**Scale and capacity**
- Ability to support large or complex engagements.

**Differentiation**
- Unique capabilities, tooling, or processes.

**Example scoring grid**

| Competitor | Depth | Specialization | Quality | Credibility | Experience | Value | Scale | Differentiation | Overall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Competitor A |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Competitor B |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 6) Positioning Framework

Define a position that is *credible, unique, and meaningful*.

**Positioning statement template**
> For [target segment] who [core need], [brand/service] delivers [unique outcome] by [key differentiator], unlike [primary competitor] who [limitation].

**Key positioning elements**
- **Target segment**: the buyer and the context.
- **Primary pain point**: urgent risk, compliance deadline, security maturity.
- **Unique outcome**: measurable business result or risk reduction.
- **Differentiator**: method, focus, expertise, or delivery model.

---

## 7) Differentiation Strategy

Differentiate along axes that matter to clients and are defensible over time.

### Differentiation levers
- **Vertical specialization**: deep industry compliance knowledge (e.g., HIPAA, PCI, SOX, CJIS).
- **Delivery model**: rapid assessments, subscription-based advisory, embedded security team.
- **Depth of technical expertise**: advanced red team/blue team capabilities, cloud-native security.
- **Business alignment**: risk reduction tied to revenue, uptime, or audit success.
- **Speed and responsiveness**: SLAs, rapid response, emergency coverage.
- **Outcome orientation**: measurable improvements (e.g., audit pass rate, MTTD/MTTR reductions).
- **Proprietary tooling**: customized risk scoring, continuous compliance tracking.
- **Transparency and education**: client enablement and documentation excellence.

### Defensible differentiation checklist
- Can you maintain this advantage for 12–24 months?
- Is the advantage meaningful to buyers and not just “nice to have”?
- Can you prove it with case studies or data?

---

## 8) Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

### UVP formula
> [Brand] helps [target segment] achieve [primary outcome] by [unique approach], with [proof/credibility].

### UVP examples (adapt to your niche)
- “We help SaaS teams pass SOC 2 audits in 8–10 weeks using our compliance sprint model and automated evidence collection.”
- “We reduce breach risk for healthcare providers by embedding security engineers in their release cycles, backed by HIPAA and HITRUST expertise.”
- “We deliver actionable pen tests with remediation coaching, so you can fix issues in weeks, not months.”

### Proof points to include
- Compliance outcomes (audit pass rate, time-to-certification).
- Response timelines (incident response SLAs).
- Reductions in vulnerabilities or risk exposure.
- Industry-recognized certifications (CISSP, OSCP, CISM).
- References and client testimonials.

---

## 9) Messaging and Narrative

Craft messages for each buyer persona and use case.

### Persona messaging
- **CISO/Head of Security**: risk reduction, maturity improvement, executive reporting.
- **CTO/Engineering**: integration with CI/CD, time-to-fix, practical guidance.
- **Compliance/Legal**: audit readiness, documentation, policy alignment.
- **CEO/Founder**: business continuity, trust signal, customer retention.

### Messaging hierarchy
1. **Outcome**: the business impact.
2. **Proof**: evidence and examples.
3. **Method**: how you do it differently.
4. **Offer**: service package or engagement format.
