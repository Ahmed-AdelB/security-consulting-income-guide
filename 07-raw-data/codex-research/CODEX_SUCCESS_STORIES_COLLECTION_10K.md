## 3. vCISO & Consulting Income Proofs (The "Retainer" Kings)

### 3.1 The "Solo Enterprise" ($500k+ Earners)
> **The $720k/year Fractional CISO:**
> *"I manage 4 clients as a fractional CISO. **$15k/month each = $60k/month ($720k/year)**. I work 60-70 hours a week, but I make double what I did as a full-time CISO at $350k."* — (`r/cybersecurity`)

> **The "Full Independent" Playbook ($514k/yr):**
> *   **Core:** 4x Fractional CISO clients @ $8k/mo = **$384k**.
> *   **Project:** 1-2 Gap Assessments/Qtr @ $15k = **$90k**.
> *   **Niche:** Expert Witness (2 cases/yr) @ $400/hr = **$40k**.

### 3.2 The "Side-Hustle Stack" ($300k+ Earners)
> **The "Risk-Averse" Playbook ($300k/yr):**
> *   **Day Job:** Senior Security Engineer (Remote) @ **$180k**.
> *   **Hustle 1:** 2x Retainer Clients (Advisory) @ $3k/mo = **$72k**.
> *   **Hustle 2:** Expert Networks (2 calls/week) @ $500/hr = **$48k**.

*   **Mid Tier:** Security instructors on Udemy/Pluralsight earning **$10k-$30k/year** in passive royalties.
