| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Junior / Mid** | Red Team Operator | **$80 - $130** | €75 - €120 | often sub-contracted by larger firms |

| **Expert / Niche** | Exploit Dev / AI Red Team | **$300 - $500+** | €280 - €450+ | Specialized (e.g., Mainframe, SCADA, LLM attacks) |

### Daily Rate Benchmarks
