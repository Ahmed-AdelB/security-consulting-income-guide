## Crypto inventory and data protection alignment (from CODEX_SECURITY_PROGRAM_10K.md)
- Asset management emphasizes knowing what is owned and where it resides.
- Inventory should include devices, applications, cloud resources, and data stores.
- Configuration management ensures secure baselines for cryptographic services.
- Data protection domain covers data discovery, classification, and encryption.
- Roadmaps often start with data discovery, classification, and encryption.
- Data protection intersects with legal and compliance obligations (PII, PHI, PCI).
- Asset inventories should include cryptographic dependencies and key stores.
- Inventory outputs should feed risk registers and governance reporting.
- Classification should map to encryption standards and retention policies.
- Encryption standards should be documented and measurable.
- Policy and procedure alignment is necessary for auditability.
- Data protection goals should inform PQC migration priorities.
- Inventory completeness should be tracked as a metric.
- Unmanaged assets are a common source of breaches.
- Discovery work should identify legacy crypto and shadow key stores.
- Classification should identify systems requiring highest assurance.

## Key management lifecycle mapping (from CODEX_CRYPTO_SECURITY_10K.md)
### Key generation
- Strong, verifiable entropy sources are essential.
- Hardware-based randomness or HSM-based generation is preferred.
- Key ceremonies should be formalized with documented steps.
- Roles in key ceremonies should be defined and audited.
- Separation of roles prevents single-operator control.

### Key storage
- HSMs and secure enclaves provide hardware-backed key storage.
- MPC and threshold schemes split key material into shares.
- Cold storage reduces exposure but increases operational overhead.
- Storage architecture should match risk and liquidity needs.

### Key usage
- Policy enforcement should precede signing operations.
- Signing processes must be isolated from general workloads.
- Every signing operation should be logged with cryptographic integrity.
- Approval workflows should enforce limits and whitelists.
- Audit logs should be protected from tampering.

### Rotation and revocation
- Periodic rotation reduces exposure in stealth compromise scenarios.
- Event-driven rotation should follow personnel or vendor changes.
- Revocation procedures should be explicit and rehearsed.
- Migration plans must account for key retirement and replacement.

### Backup and recovery
- Sharded backups reduce single-point exposure.
- Backups should be stored across multiple secure locations.
- Disaster recovery testing validates recovery feasibility.
- Key escrow introduces legal and operational risks.
- Escrow policies should define conditions and access controls.

### Auditability and documentation
- The lifecycle should be documented, repeatable, and auditable.
- Written procedures should match operational practice.
- Evidence should be collected for audits and compliance reviews.

## Cryptographic control designs (from CODEX_CRYPTO_SECURITY_10K.md)
### MPC (threshold signatures)
- MPC splits a private key into shares that never recombine.
- Signing requires a threshold of participants.
- Strength: strong confidentiality with no single key exposure.
- Challenge: operational complexity and vendor trust.
- Assessment focus: protocol implementation security and device provisioning.

### Multisig
- Multisig requires multiple signatures from independent keys.
- Authorization is visible and transparent on-chain.
- Strength: straightforward mental model and shared control.
- Challenge: coordination delays and key loss complexity.
- Assessment focus: secure key storage, signer independence, recovery.

### Hybrid approaches
- Hybrid designs combine MPC and multisig for layered trust.
- Example: MPC within a signer, multisig across signers.
- Hybrid models can reduce insider collusion risk.
- Hybrid designs must be documented and tested for recovery.

### Key ceremony impacts
- MPC and multisig both require disciplined key ceremonies.
- MPC ceremonies involve vendor-specific protocols and devices.
- Multisig ceremonies require independent devices or HSMs.
- Assessments should verify configuration, storage, and recovery across signers.

## Governance and operational controls (from CODEX_CRYPTO_SECURITY_10K.md)
- Crypto custody security depends on organizational discipline as much as technical controls.
- Role-based access control should enforce least privilege.
- Critical roles include key management operators, approvers, and audit reviewers.
- Segregation of duties should prevent single-person control.
- Policy engines should be treated as security-critical components.
- Policy engines require code review, change management, and audit logging.
- Change management should cover policy, signing logic, and infrastructure updates.
- Operational controls should be verified during assessments.
- Documentation should capture how controls are implemented in practice.
- Operational weaknesses are frequently the root cause of incidents.
- Incident response should include crypto-specific escalation paths.

## Security program alignment for PQC migration (from CODEX_SECURITY_PROGRAM_10K.md)
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance: track quantum risk in risk registers and reporting.
- Asset and Configuration Management: maintain crypto inventories and secure baselines.
- Identity and Access Management: ensure cryptographic admin roles are controlled.
- Data Protection and Privacy: map classification to encryption and retention.
- Security Architecture and Engineering: define hybrid crypto reference architectures.
- Vulnerability and Patch Management: include crypto library updates in patch cadence.
- Security Monitoring and Detection: log signing operations and crypto events.
- Incident Response and Crisis Management: plan for key compromise scenarios.
- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery: test key recovery and escrow procedures.
- Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk: validate vendor PQC readiness.
