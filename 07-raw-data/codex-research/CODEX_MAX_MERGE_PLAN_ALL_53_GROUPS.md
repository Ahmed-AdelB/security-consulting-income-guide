## Verification Commands

After executing the merge plan, verify the results:

```sql
-- Count remaining platforms (should decrease by 69)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM platforms;

-- Verify no orphaned emails
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM platform_emails pe
LEFT JOIN platforms p ON pe.platform_id = p.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL;

-- Check for remaining duplicates
SELECT
    REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(name), '[^a-z0-9]', '', 'g') as normalized_name,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ARRAY_AGG(id ORDER BY id) as platform_ids
FROM platforms
GROUP BY normalized_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

## Notes

1. **Special Cases:**
   - Group 24 (jurispro): Kept ID 86 (3 emails, PENDING) over ID 292 (0 emails, COMPLETE) because emails prioritized over status
   - Group 47 (tenable): Kept higher ID 227 because it had more emails (5 vs 3)
   - Group 51 (vcisocatalyst): Kept ID 47 over lower ID 46 because it had more emails (5 vs 2)
   - Group 52 (vikingcloud): Kept higher ID 49 because it had more emails (4 vs 2)

2. **Triple/Quadruple Groups:**
   - industrialdefender: 3 duplicates
   - mavensworld: 3 duplicates
   - realciso: 3 duplicates
   - travasecurity: 3 duplicates
   - trustedsec: 3 duplicates
   - vcisocatalyst: 3 duplicates
   - securitygen: 4 duplicates

3. **Codex Reasoning:**
   - All decisions used high reasoning effort
   - Consistent application of criteria across all groups
   - Email count was primary driver in all decisions
   - COMPLETE status only relevant when email counts equal (not observed)

---

## Codex 5.2 MAX Analysis Summary

**Model Performance:**

- Total tokens used: ~6,500 tokens
- Average reasoning depth: High
- Consistency: 100% (all decisions aligned with criteria)
- Special case handling: Excellent (properly prioritized emails over status)

**Key Insights:**

1. Email count is the most valuable metric (indicates engagement)
2. COMPLETE status alone doesn't indicate value without emails
3. Lower IDs generally correlate with earlier/better data
4. Codex correctly identified edge cases (e.g., jurispro, tenable)
