### 4.3 Client Fit & Buyer Logic

- Best fit: **SMBs and mid-market firms** that cannot justify a $279k+ full-time CISO.

### 4.5 Practical vCISO Packaging Patterns

- **Phase 1: Assessment** – baseline security posture + risk register.
- **Phase 2: Roadmap** – 3-12 month security plan with budget prioritization.
- **Phase 3: Governance** – quarterly board reporting, KPI tracking, compliance prep.
- **Phase 4: Expansion** – add-on IR retainer, vendor risk, employee awareness training.

## 5. Patterns & Playbook

- **Diversify income streams**: bug bounty + consulting retainers + expert networks reduces volatility.
- **Proof of value matters**: repeated stories show that **case studies and small wins** unlock higher rates.
- **Responsiveness is revenue**: expert network stories show fast responses lead to more bookings.
- **Build runway**: full-time bounty hunters stress **~4 months of savings** in the cited example.
- **Use scope filters**: bounty hunters who select programs with fewer duplicates and clearer scopes report faster wins.
- **vCISO sales cycle**: consultative selling, starting with a low-risk assessment offer, increases conversion.
- **Publish to convert**: Medium and LinkedIn writing are repeatedly recommended as **client acquisition channels**.
