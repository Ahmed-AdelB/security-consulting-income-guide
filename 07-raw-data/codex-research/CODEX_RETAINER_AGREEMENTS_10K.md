## 2. Retainer Fundamentals
- Retainer = prepaid, recurring fee for access plus defined monthly scope.
- Retainers are common for vCISO, expert witness, DFIR readiness, privacy DPO, and security awareness management.
- Retainers stabilize cash flow and reduce collection risk.
- Retainers give clients predictable availability and response windows.
- Retainers should define included hours or deliverables.
- Retainers should specify cadence (weekly sync, monthly report, quarterly review).
- Retainers should specify response windows (business hours vs 24/7).
- Retainers should separate baseline scope from surge response.
- Evergreen retainers auto-replenish when balance dips below threshold.
- Retainer replenishment thresholds should be explicit.
- Unused hours policy must be clear (carry-over vs expire).
- Overage rates must be priced in advance.
- Retainers should include change control for scope expansion.
- Retainers should include termination notice (30-60 days common).
- Retainers should include payment timing (Net 15/Net 30).
- Retainers should include data handling and confidentiality terms.
- Retainers are not ideal for one-off, fully defined deliverables.

## 3. Engagement Models and Fit
### 3.1 Common Engagement Models
| Model | Best For | Pricing Style | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hourly / T&M | Open-ended advisory | Hourly rate | Cap hours or set weekly max |
| Fixed-Fee Project | Defined deliverable | Milestone fee | Use change orders for new scope |
| Retainer | Ongoing governance | Monthly fee | Define hours, cadence, availability |
| Hybrid Retainer + Surge | Readiness + emergency response | Monthly + premium hourly | Ideal for DFIR |
| Subscription Pentest | Continuous testing | Quarterly/monthly fee | Include retest window |

### 3.2 Fit Signals for Retainers
- Client has recurring compliance deadlines (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR).
- Client needs leadership guidance but not a full-time CISO.
- Work is cyclical (quarterly testing, monthly training).
- Client values guaranteed availability and fast response.
- Consultant wants predictable utilization and reduced sales overhead.

### 3.3 Fit Signals for Projects Instead
- Scope is discrete with a single deliverable.
- Client cannot commit to a monthly cadence.
- Deliverables are mandatory before any ongoing work.
- Client expects one-time procurement approval.

## 8. Negotiation Playbook
### 8.1 Pricing Anchors (From Internal Templates)
- Scope-first anchor: tie rate to senior band and scope clarity.
- Premium urgency anchor: price higher for surge response or executive impact.
- Retainer + surge hybrid: baseline retainer plus premium response rate.
- Rate review clause: adjust after first milestone if scope shifts.

### 8.2 Tactics That Protect Margin
- Start 15-20% above target to leave room to negotiate.
- Tie premium pricing to compliance deadlines or urgency.
- Offer retainer discounts only for scope stability.
- Require change orders for any scope expansion.
- Align payment milestones to deliverable acceptance.
- Use minimum engagement hours for premium clients (20-40 hours).

### 8.3 Common Red Flags
- Unlimited liability or broad indemnity.
- Net 60+ payment terms or pay-when-paid clauses.
- Vague deliverables with fixed fees.
- Unlimited retesting or remediation support.
- Refusal to provide written rate confirmation.

## 9. Retainer Conversion & Renewal
