# $100K/MONTH CYBERSECURITY EXPERT INCOME STRATEGY (2025)

## RESEARCH SCOPE & INPUTS

**Objective:** Build a repeatable $100K/month income system for a senior cybersecurity expert.
**Channels:** Expert networks, vCISO/fractional CISO, bug bounty/offensive research, expert witness, training.
**Platform Inventory Source:** `app/platforms_data.py` (397 verified platforms; 75 expert networks, 19 fractional executive, 6 expert witness, 6 training).
**Time Horizon:** 12 months to reach consistent $100K/month.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The fastest path to $100K/month in cybersecurity is anchored by recurring vCISO retainers and amplified by high-rate expert network calls. Expert witness and training revenue add stability and brand leverage, while bug bounty/offensive research offers upside and keeps technical skills sharp.

**Target Monthly Mix (Base Case):**

- **vCISO Retainers (60-70%)**: 3-5 clients at $15K-$25K each
- **Expert Networks (15-25%)**: 20-35 billable hours at $400-$900/hour
- **Expert Witness (5-10%)**: 10-20 hours/month at $400-$800/hour
- **Training (5-10%)**: 1 workshop or cohort per month at $5K-$15K
- **Bug Bounty (5-10%)**: Focused, high-ROI targets and private programs

**Revenue Architecture Example ($105K/month):**

- 4 vCISO retainers @ $20K = $80K
- 25 expert-network hours @ $600 = $15K
- Expert witness case averaged monthly = $6K
- 1 corporate training workshop = $7.5K
- Bug bounty average = $3K
