## Comprehensive Research on Rates, Pricing Models, and Recurring Revenue

**Date:** December 24, 2025
**Scope:** Managed Security Services, SOC-as-a-Service, vCISO, MDR, and Recurring Revenue Models.

## 1. Executive Summary: The 2025 Security Service Market
In 2025, the Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) market is defined by a shift from "reactive monitoring" to "proactive resilience." Clients are no longer just buying firewalls; they are buying outcomes (compliance, reduced risk, business continuity). 

**Key Market Drivers:**
*   **Compliance as a Wedge:** New regulations (SEC rules, CMMC 2.0, updated NIST frameworks) are forcing SMBs to seek vCISO and GRC support.
*   **Consolidation of Tools:** Buyers prefer "Platform" approaches over point solutions. MSSPs bundling SOC+MDR+GRC are winning.
*   **Subscription Economy:** 90%+ of high-performing MSSP revenue is now recurring (MRR), driven by per-user or per-asset subscriptions.

## 3. SOC as a Service (SOCaaS) Pricing
For MSPs looking to resell, or MSSPs building their stack.

### Wholesale / Reseller Costs (Cost to MSP)
*   **Per Endpoint Model:** **$8 - $15 per endpoint/month**.
    *   *Includes:* 24/7 automated monitoring + human triage of critical alerts.
*   **Per User Model:** **$10 - $25 per user/month**.
    *   *Includes:* Endpoint + M365/Email monitoring.
*   **Flat Rate SOC:** **$1,500 - $3,000 / month** block for up to X endpoints.

### Retail Pricing (Price to End Client)
*   **Markup:** Typically **2x - 3x** wholesale cost.
*   **Standalone SOCaaS:** Sold at **$30 - $60 per endpoint/month** to clients who already have IT but need security.
*   **Minimums:** Many providers enforce a **$1,500/month minimum** to engage.

### Build vs. Buy (2025 Reality)
*   **Building In-House SOC:** Requires minimum 6-8 analysts for true 24/7 coverage.
    *   *Est. Cost:* **$800k - $1.2M / year** (Salaries, Tools, Training).
*   **Outsourcing SOCaaS:**
    *   *Est. Cost:* **$50k - $100k / year** for a mid-sized MSP to cover their client base.
    *   *Verdict:* Outsourcing is the only viable path for 95% of MSPs.

## 6. Recurring Revenue (MRR) Strategy for 2025

To build a "Massive" income stream, successful firms are moving away from "Line Items" and towards "Outcome Bundles."

### The "Security Stack" MRR Calculation
*Example for a 50-user Client:*

1.  **Foundational Stack (User Support):** $150/user $\times$ 50 = **$7,500/mo**
2.  **Advanced Security Layer (MDR/SOC):** $50/user $\times$ 50 = **$2,500/mo**
3.  **vCISO Retainer (Compliance/Strategy):** Flat Fee = **$3,000/mo**
4.  **Cloud Backup/DR:** $20/user $\times$ 50 = **$1,000/mo**
---------------------------------------------------------
**Total MRR:** **$14,000 / month** ($168k/year) from *one* client.

### Key Takeaway
The money is in the **convergence**. Do not sell "Antivirus" ($3 profit). Sell "Ransomware Protection & Warranty" ($50 profit). Do not sell "Consulting Hours" ($200 once). Sell "Compliance Assurance" ($4,000/month forever).
