### 4. 2025 Market Drivers
1.  **AI & Deepfakes:** The barrier to entry for attackers has lowered. "Script kiddies" can now generate perfect English emails and clone voices. Companies are terrified and paying premiums for tests that include these vectors.
2.  **Remote/Hybrid Work:** The "perimeter" is now the employee's home. Vishing attacks targeting VPN credentials and 2FA bypass are surging.
3.  **Regulatory Pressure:**
    *   **SEC Rules:** Public companies must disclose material incidents, driving proactive testing.
    *   **Insurance:** Cyber insurance carriers are mandating social engineering tests as a condition for coverage.
4.  **Ransomware Initial Access:** Most ransomware starts with a phish. Preventing the initial foothold is high value.

### 5. Packaging Your Services (The "Bundle" Strategy)
Don't sell "a phishing test." Sell a **"Human Risk Reduction Program."**

**The "Human Firewall" Package ($25k - $40k/year)**
1.  **Baseline Assessment:** Initial phish/vish to establish risk level.
2.  **Quarterly Simulations:** 4 Phishing + 2 Vishing campaigns.
3.  **OSINT Report:** "What can hackers find about your executives online?"
4.  **Training Workshops:** Live or recorded sessions based on assessment failures.
5.  **Policy Review:** Updating the "Acceptable Use" and "Verification" policies.

### 6. Tools of the Trade (Low Overhead, High Margin)
*   **Phishing Frameworks:** GoPhish (Free/Open Source), Evilginx2 (MFA Bypass).
*   **Vishing:** SpoofCard, VoIP setups, Voice Changers (AI-based).
*   **OSINT:** Maltego, Recon-ng, Shodan, LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
*   **Physical:** Badge cloners (Proxmark3), Lockpicks, Under-door tools.

**Conclusion:** Social Engineering consulting offers one of the highest profit margins in cybersecurity because it relies heavily on *skill and creativity* rather than expensive enterprise software. A single $15,000 engagement might only require $50 in infrastructure costs.
