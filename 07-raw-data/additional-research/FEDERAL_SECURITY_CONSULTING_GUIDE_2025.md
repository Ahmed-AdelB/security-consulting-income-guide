## 2. Follow the Money: FY2025 Budget & Spending Analysis

To win contracts, you must know who has the funding. The FY2025 budget allocations reveal specific high-value targets.

### Top Agency Spenders
| Agency | 2025 Cyber Budget | Primary Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dept. of Defense (DoD)** | **$14.5 Billion** | Zero Trust implementation, Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC), Offensive Cyber Operations. |
| **DHS (CISA)** | **$3.0 Billion** | Federal network defense (CDM), Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR), Critical Infrastructure reporting. |
| **Dept. of Justice (DOJ)** | **N/A (Classified)** | FBI Cyber capabilities, Counter-intelligence, National Security Division cyber section expansion (+$25M). |
| **HHS (Health)** | **$1.3 Billion** | **NEW:** Hospital cybersecurity incentive program ($500M) & implementation assistance ($800M). |
| **Treasury** | **$150 Million** | Financial sector critical infrastructure protection, "Cybersecurity Enhancement Account." |

**Strategic Pivot:**
*   **For GRC Consultants:** Target **HHS** and hospital networks. The $1.3B injection for hospital cyber resilience is a massive, brand-new market for 2025.
*   **For Technical/Ops:** **CISA's** $470M allocation for EDR and network tools is the primary target for deployment and engineering support.

## 3. The GSA Vehicle: SIN 54151HACS Deep Dive

The **Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS)** SIN (Special Item Number) `54151HACS` is the golden ticket for prime contracts. It eliminates the need for agencies to issue a new solicitation for every project.

### The 5 Sub-Categories (Know Your Niche)
You cannot just be "Cyber." You must qualify for specific sub-categories:
1.  **High Value Asset (HVA) Assessments:** Deep-dive assessments of mission-critical systems. (Highest Bill Rates)
2.  **Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA):** Standard scanning, database scanning, and web app scanning.
3.  **Cyber Hunt:** Proactive threat hunting on government networks.
4.  **Incident Response (IR):** Forensics, malware analysis, and recovery.
5.  **Penetration Testing:** Red teaming and offensive security.

### Real-World Vendor Examples (2025 Active)
*   *Paragon Cyber Solutions* (Small Business / 8(a))
*   *Phoenix Cyber*
*   *GuidePoint Security*
*   *Cyber Defense Technologies*

**Action Item:** Search **GSA eLibrary** for these vendors. If you are a solo consultant, **do not** try to get your own schedule immediately. Instead, approach these specific vendors to serve as a **subcontractor** on their existing HACS vehicles.

## 4. SETA: The "Hidden" Market
**SETA (Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance)** contractors are the government's "right hand." They provide the technical expertise to manage *other* contractors.

*   **Role:** You sit in the government office (SCIF), write requirements, oversee tests, and advise Program Managers (PMs).
*   **The Catch:** **OCI (Organizational Conflict of Interest).** If you are a SETA, you generally cannot bid on the system you are helping to build/buy.
*   **Clearance:** TS/SCI is almost universally required.

### Top SETA/Support Companies to Target for Subcontracting
These firms hold massive "Program Management" and "Engineering Support" IDIQs and constantly need cleared bodies:
1.  **Leidos** (Specifically the "CT SETA" contract with CISA)
2.  **Booz Allen Hamilton** (The giant of SETA support across DoD/Intel)
3.  **CACI Federal** (Heavy Intel/Defense focus)
4.  **Peraton** (DHS/State Dept support)
5.  **Marshal Group** (Niche DoD support)
6.  **Bruinwave Solutions** (DHS CISA program management)
7.  **ECS Federal** (DARPA support)

**Job Titles to Search:**
*   *ISSE (Information Systems Security Engineer)* - The classic SETA technical role.
*   *ISSO (Information Systems Security Officer)* - The classic SETA compliance role.
*   *Cyber Technical Advisor*

## 6. Small Business Programs: The "Hunting License"

If you are establishing a firm, these certifications are effectively "licenses to hunt" in restricted pools.

1.  **8(a) Business Development Program:**
    *   *Power:* Sole-source awards up to $4.5M (no competition).
    *   *Strategy:* Partner with an 8(a) Native American or Alaskan Native Corporation (ANC). They have higher caps ($100M+) and are always looking for technical subs.
2.  **SDVOSB (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned):**
    *   *Power:* The VA *must* prioritize SDVOSBs.
    *   *Strategy:* "Kingdomware" Supreme Court ruling mandates the "Rule of Two" (if two SDVOSBs can do the work, it *must* be set aside for them).
3.  **WOSB (Woman-Owned Small Business):**
    *   *Power:* Increasing set-asides in civilian agencies (EDWOSB is even better).

## 7. Immediate Action Plan

1.  **Register:** SAM.gov (Unique Entity ID is mandatory).
2.  **Verify:** Get your **CAGE Code**.
3.  **Certify:** If eligible, submit for SDVOSB or WOSB immediately (8(a) takes longer).
4.  **Network:** Join the **AFCEA** (Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association) or **INSA** (Intelligence and National Security Alliance). These are the *primary* networking hubs for federal contractors.
5.  **Search:** Use `USASpending.gov` to find which 8(a) firms won Cyber contracts in the last 90 days. Call them. Say: *"I see you won the [Contract Name]. I have a cleared ISSE ready to deploy who specializes in [Niche]. We want to sub."*
