## MSSP Partnership Models

### Market Opportunity

**2025 Statistics:**

- **67%** of MSPs/MSSPs now offer vCISO services (up from 21% in 2024)
- **319% YoY growth** in vCISO adoption
- **50%** of remaining providers plan to launch by end of 2025
- **98%** of non-adopters plan to offer vCISO services eventually

**Why MSPs/MSSPs Are Adding vCISO:**

- **59%** increased revenue and/or margins
- **43%** improved customer security
- **38%** increased client engagement
- **38%** upsold additional products/services

### Partnership Model Options

#### Model 1: Referral Partnership (Lowest Commitment)

**Structure:**

- MSP refers clients to independent vCISO consultant
- vCISO provides services under own brand
- MSP receives finder's fee

**Economics:**

- **Referral Fee:** 10-15% of monthly retainer (ongoing) or one-time $1,000-$3,000
- **Example:** Client at $6,000/month = $600-$900/month to MSP = $7,200-$10,800/year

**Pros:**

- No MSP investment required
- Easy to start
- Passive income for MSP
- vCISO maintains full control

**Cons:**

- Lowest revenue for MSP
- Limited client stickiness
- MSP may not prioritize referrals

#### Model 2: Co-Delivery Partnership

**Structure:**

- MSP handles client relationship, project management, basic security
- vCISO provides strategic guidance, compliance expertise, assessments
- Joint delivery under MSP brand or co-branded

**Economics:**

- **Revenue Split:** 30-40% to MSP, 60-70% to vCISO
- **Example:** Client at $8,000/month
  - MSP: $2,400-$3,200/month (30-40%)
  - vCISO: $4,800-$5,600/month (60-70%)

**MSP Responsibilities:**

- Client onboarding and account management
- Tool implementation
- Monthly client meetings
- Basic security monitoring
- Billing and invoicing

**vCISO Responsibilities:**

- Risk assessments
- Compliance framework expertise
- Policy development
- Strategic roadmap
- Executive reporting
- Audit preparation

**Pros:**

- Higher MSP margins than referral
- Shared workload
- vCISO focuses on expertise areas
- MSP deepens client relationships

**Cons:**

- Requires coordination and communication
- Revenue split negotiations
- Potential for role confusion

#### Model 3: White-Label Partnership

**Structure:**

- vCISO delivers services entirely under MSP brand
- MSP owns client relationship
- Client may not know about vCISO involvement

**Economics:**

- **Revenue Split:** 40-50% to MSP, 50-60% to vCISO
- **Example:** Client at $10,000/month
  - MSP: $4,000-$5,000/month (40-50%)
  - vCISO: $5,000-$6,000/month (50-60%)

**MSP Responsibilities:**

- All client-facing communication
- Sales and marketing
- Billing
- Client relationship management
- Tool licensing and access

**vCISO Responsibilities:**

- Work requests from MSP
- Stay behind the scenes
- May use MSP email domain

**Pros:**

- MSP builds brand equity
- Higher client retention for MSP
- vCISO focuses purely on delivery
- Scalable for vCISO (multiple MSP partners)

**Cons:**

- Lower revenue % for vCISO (but potentially higher volume)
- Less direct client interaction
- Dependent on MSP sales capability
- MSP controls pricing and margins

#### Model 4: Platform Reseller Partnership

**Structure:**

- MSP licenses vCISO platform (Cynomi, RealCISO)
- Hires or contracts vCISO consultant(s) to deliver
- Platform provides automation, MSP manages sales, vCISO provides expertise

**Economics:**

- **Platform Cost:** $200-$2,000/month (varies by client count)
- **vCISO Compensation:** $50-$150/hour or 30-50% of client fees
- **MSP Margin:** 20-40% after platform and vCISO costs

**Example:**

- Client pays MSP: $6,000/month
- Platform cost: $500/month (amortized across clients)
- vCISO consultant: $2,000/month (20 hours at $100/hr)
- MSP net: $3,500/month (58% margin)

**Pros:**

- AI automation enables scale
- Lower vCISO labor costs per client
- Standardized processes
- Professional client portals
- MSP can manage multiple vCISO consultants

**Cons:**

- Platform licensing cost
- Learning curve for platform
- Less customization

5. Present partnership proposal with revenue projections
6. Pilot with 1-2 clients before full partnership

**Value Proposition to MSP:**

- "Increase client retention by 30% with security services"
- "Meet client demand for compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001)"

## Risk & Insurance Considerations

### Professional Liability Requirements

#### Cyber E&O Insurance (Essential)

**What It Covers:**

- Errors and omissions in security advice
- Failure to prevent breaches despite consulting
- Data breach at client attributed to vCISO guidance
- Regulatory violations due to compliance advice errors
- Legal defense costs

**Recommended Coverage:**

- **Minimum:** $1 million per occurrence
- **Recommended:** $2 million per occurrence / $2 million aggregate
- **Enterprise Clients:** May require $5 million+

**Annual Costs:**

- $2,000-$6,000/year for $1M-$2M coverage
- Depends on: revenue, client count, industries served, claims history

**Key Policy Features:**

- Prior acts coverage (retroactive date)
- Defense costs outside policy limits
- Regulatory defense coverage
- Breach of contract coverage

**Top Carriers:**

- Hiscox
- CNA
- Beazley
- Coalition
- Cowbell Cyber

#### CISO Liability Insurance (Emerging)

**Background:**

- CISOs increasingly held personally liable for breaches
- SEC enforcement actions targeting individual CISOs
- Personal assets at risk

**Coverage Sources:**

- Standalone CISO liability policies (new in 2024-2025)
- Well-brokered D&O (Directors & Officers) policies
- Cyber policies with CISO liability riders

**Why vCISOs Need It:**

- Advisory role creates liability exposure
- Clients may sue if breach occurs
- Regulatory actions can target advisors
- Personal financial protection

**Cost:** $3,000-$10,000/year (depending on scope)

#### General Liability Insurance

**What It Covers:**

- Bodily injury at client site
- Property damage
- Advertising injury

**Coverage:** $1 million per occurrence
**Cost:** $500-$1,500/year

**When Required:**

- Client contracts often mandate
- Working on-site at client locations
- Hosting events or training

### Client Contract Risk Mitigation

#### Limitation of Liability Clauses

**Standard Approach:**

- Limit liability to amount paid in past 12 months
- Example: "$6,000/month client = maximum liability $72,000"

**Negotiation Points:**

- Exclude gross negligence and willful misconduct
- Specify indirect/consequential damages exclusions
- Cap on direct damages

**Sample Clause:**

> "Consultant's total liability for any claims arising out of this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by Client in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim."

#### Indemnification Provisions

**Mutual Indemnification (Preferred):**

- Each party indemnifies for their own negligence
- No one-sided indemnification

**Avoid:**

- Indemnifying client for their own negligence
- Unlimited indemnification obligations
- Indemnifying third-party claims unrelated to vCISO services

**Insurance Carve-Out:**

> "Indemnification obligations shall not exceed the limits of Consultant's professional liability insurance coverage."

#### Disclaimers & Limitations

**Include in Contracts:**

- No guarantee of zero breaches
- Advisory role, not implementation
- Client responsibility for final decisions
- Threat landscape constantly evolving

**Sample Disclaimer:**

> "Consultant provides advisory services and strategic guidance. Client retains full responsibility for implementation, ongoing management, and ultimate security of Client's systems. No security program can guarantee prevention of all cyber incidents."
