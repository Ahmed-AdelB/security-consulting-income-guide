- **Full remote:** Increasing number of roles paying 100% regardless of location

**Beneficiaries:**

- Penetration testers: "Remote work has bridged this divide" - no longer need to live in major cities
- Cloud security: Remote-friendly by nature
- Security consultants: Already accustomed to remote/travel model

## KEY FINDINGS & INSIGHTS

### 1. Salary Range Observations

- **Wide variance within roles:** 2-3x difference between 10th and 90th percentiles
- **Source discrepancies:** PayScale tends conservative (base salary); Glassdoor/Indeed higher (total comp)
- **Sample size matters:** Small samples (e.g., AppSec with 15 responses) may not reflect true market

### 2. Experience vs. Specialization

**Experience Wins Long-Term:**

- Entry to senior: 67-291% salary growth
- 20+ years: Can reach 5x entry-level salary
- Executive roles (CISO): Highest ceiling ($500k+)

**Specialization Wins Short-Term:**

- Rare skills (OT/ICS, blockchain): +50-80%
- Certifications: +$15k-$40k per significant cert

**Optimal Strategy:** Combine both - specialized experience commands highest premiums

### 3. Location vs. Remote Trade-offs

**Traditional Model (Pre-2020):**

- Must live in SF/NYC/Seattle for top salaries
- 2-3x salary but 1.5-2x cost of living
