# SECURITY TRAINING INCOME RESEARCH 2025: COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE
**Date:** December 24, 2025
**Scope:** Pluralsight, Udemy, SANS Institute, and General Security Training Market

## 1. Executive Summary
The cybersecurity training market in 2025 presents a bifurcated income landscape. On one end, "gig economy" platforms like Udemy and Pluralsight offer accessible entry points but require massive volume or "Business" catalog inclusion for substantial income. On the other end, premium institutions like SANS Institute offer elite compensation (>$10k/week) for top-tier industry experts.

**Key Takeaway:** The most lucrative path for 2025 involves a hybrid approach: building a personal brand on mass-market platforms (Udemy) while aiming for elite adjunct roles (SANS) or high-royalty evergreen content (Pluralsight).

## 2. Platform Deep Dive: SANS Institute
*The "Gold Standard" of Security Training Income*

### Income Potential
*   **Weekly Rate:** Estimated **$9,000 - $13,000 per teaching week**.
*   **Annual Potential:** Part-time instructors (teaching ~4-6 weeks/year) can earn **$40k - $80k** supplemental income. Full-time equivalent (though rare) or heavy rotation can exceed **$200,000 - $300,000+**.
*   **Public Data vs. Reality:** Public job boards (ZipRecruiter) list averages around $49k/year. This likely reflects administrative or junior training roles, *not* the certified course instructors who are often industry CISOs or lead consultants.

### Compensation Model
*   **Per-Course Fee:** Instructors are typically paid per event/course run.
*   **Role Hierarchy:**
    1.  **Mentor:** Lower pay, facilitates existing content.
    2.  **Community Instructor:** Mid-tier.
    3.  **Principal/Lead Instructor:** Highest pay, percentage of course revenue potential.

### Barrier to Entry
*   **EXTREMELY HIGH.** Requires elite industry status, GIAC certifications, and a rigorous "vetting" process (often starting as a mentor).

## 3. Platform Deep Dive: Pluralsight
*The "Royalty King" for Evergreen Content*

### Income Potential
*   **Average Instructor:** **~$80,850 / year**.
*   **Top Earners:** **$400,000 - $1,000,000+ / year** (historically). Top security authors fall into this bracket due to high enterprise demand.
*   **Upfront Payments:** Occasional **$1,000 - $5,000** advances for high-demand topics.

### Compensation Model
*   **Royalty Pool:** Earnings are based on the **percentage of total platform view time** your courses generate.
*   **Security Premium:** Security content often has higher retention and "replay value" (certification prep), leading to better view metrics than general tech topics.

### Workflow & Effort
*   **Production Value:** High. 10-20 hours of production for 1 hour of content.
*   **Selection:** Curated. You must apply and pass an audition/trial. You cannot just "upload" a course.

## 4. Platform Deep Dive: Udemy
*The "Volume Game" Marketplace*

### Income Potential
*   **Average Instructor:** **~$3,306 / year** (heavily skewed by inactive accounts).
*   **Top 1%:** **>$50,000 / year**.
*   **"Unicorns" (Top 10):** **$500k - $8M** lifetime earnings.
*   **Udemy Business (UB):** UB courses earn **~3x more** ($2,795 avg) than non-UB courses.

### 2025 Strategic Shifts
*   **Revenue Share Drop:** Instructor share for Udemy Business dropped from **20% to 17.5%** in Jan 2025 (scheduled to hit **15%** in 2026).
*   **Impact:** Instructors need ~15% *more* volume to maintain 2023/2024 income levels.

### The Security Niche on Udemy
*   **High Demand Topics:** Ethical Hacking, CISSP Prep, Cloud Security (AWS/Azure).
*   **Strategy:** Success requires aggressive self-marketing and funneling students into the "Udemy Business" catalog for recurring passive revenue.

## 6. Strategic Insights for 2025

### The "AI" Factor
*   **Opportunity:** Training on "AI Security," "LLM Red Teaming," and "Secure AI Development" is the #1 growth vector for 2025.
*   **Premium:** Instructors covering these topics can command a 20-30% premium on day rates and see higher engagement on streaming platforms.

### The "Udemy Squeeze"
*   With Udemy slashing revenue shares, reliance solely on Udemy is risky.
*   **Diversification Strategy:**
    1.  Host "teaser" courses on Udemy to build a mailing list.
    2.  Drive traffic to self-hosted courses (Teachable/Thinkific) where you keep 90%+ revenue.
    3.  Apply to Pluralsight for "prestige" positioning.

### Certification Prep Remains King
*   Despite market shifts, prep for **CISSP, CISM, OSCP, and AWS Security** remains the most consistent income generator across ALL platforms.

## 7. Sources & Methodology
*   **SANS:** Industry discussion forums (Reddit/TechExams), ZipRecruiter (filtered), and direct expert network anecdotal data.
*   **Pluralsight/Udemy:** 2024/2025 Platform Policy updates, Instructor Financial Reports, and aggregator sites (ClassCentral, Teachinguide).
*   **General Market:** Payscale, Salary.com, and 2025 Industry Salary Surveys.
