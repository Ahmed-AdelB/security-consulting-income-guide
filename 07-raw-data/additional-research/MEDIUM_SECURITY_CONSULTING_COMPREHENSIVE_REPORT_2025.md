## Key Lessons Learned

### From Bug Bounty Hunters:

1. **Income Variability is Real**
   - "Found Bugs, Got paid, Stayed poor" - income highly unpredictable

   - All submissions can be flagged as duplicates beyond your control

2. **Timeline to Success is Long**
   - Expect 6-12 months before first $1,000 month
   - 2-3 years to reach sustainable full-time income
   - 95% of bug bounty hunters quit

3. **Platform Matters**
   - Synack: No duplicates, still get rewarded, fast payouts (1-2 days)
   - HackerOne: Largest platform, most programs, highest top earners

   - Can make $2,500-$4,000 on single program following same pattern
   - Easier to find than critical vulnerabilities

5. **Location Impacts Viability**
   - In India, $1,000-$2,000/month = comfortable life
