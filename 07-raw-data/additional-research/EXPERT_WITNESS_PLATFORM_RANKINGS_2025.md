## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Over-Investing Too Early

**Problem:** Spending $2,000+ on paid directories before establishing track record
**Solution:** Start with 100% free platforms (Expert Institute, Round Table Group)

### Mistake #2: Generic Positioning

**Problem:** Listing as "cybersecurity expert" (too broad)
**Solution:** Niche down to "cloud security forensics" or "BIPA compliance expert"

### Mistake #3: No Written Agreement

**Problem:** Starting work without retention agreement = non-payment risk
**Solution:** NEVER begin work without signed agreement and retainer

### Mistake #4: Underpricing

**Problem:** Charging $150-200/hour signals low credibility
**Solution:** Research SEAK data, start at $350-400/hour minimum

### Mistake #5: Passive Approach

**Problem:** Just listing on directories and waiting
**Solution:** Active networking, speaking, publishing, attorney relationship-building
