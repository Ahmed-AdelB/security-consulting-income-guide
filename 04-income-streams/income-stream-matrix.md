## 2. DEEP DIVE: STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### 2.1 The "Golden Ratio" of Income (High Rate / Low Friction)
*   **Winner:** **Expert Networks** & **Board Advisory**
*   **Why:** These streams offer the highest dollar-per-hour return with the lowest operational friction (no deliverables, no bug reports, just expertise).
*   **Strategy:** Use these to fill gaps between major consulting engagements. A single GLG call ($500) pays for a day of marketing effort.

### 2.2 The "Wealth Builder" (Scalability)
*   **Winner:** **Course Creation** & **Bug Bounty**
*   **Why:** These are the only channels decoupled from time.
    *   *Courses:* A course recorded in 2024 can pay rent in 2026.
    *   *Bug Bounty:* A single critical find (e.g., $50k) can equal 3 months of consulting work.
*   **Risk:** High failure rate. Most courses earn <$100/mo; most bug hunters earn $0.

### 2.3 The "Reliable Engine" (Cash Flow)
*   **Winner:** **vCISO** & **GRC Consulting**
*   **Why:** Retainers provide predictability.
    *   *vCISO:* 4 clients @ $5k/mo = $240k/yr base. Reliable, sticky, and recession-resistant (compliance is mandatory).
    *   *GRC:* SOC 2 readiness is a standardized product with clear pricing ($15k-$40k) and defined timelines.
