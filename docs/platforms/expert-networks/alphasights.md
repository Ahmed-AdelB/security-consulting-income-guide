## 3. Market Position and Network Size
- Consistently ranked #2 or #3 expert network globally by revenue and volume.
- Focuses on "custom recruiting" rather than just database mining.
- Unlike GLG (database first), AlphaSights associates actively headhunt for specific projects.
- Known for the "AlphaSights Academy" training for associates, resulting in a very specific, polished, but pushy communication style.
- Network size is vast but they prioritize "fresh" experts over "stale" database entries.
- Dominates the Private Equity due diligence market segment.
- Competes directly with GLG and Dialectica; often considered "higher touch" than GLG.
- Global footprint with major hubs in London, NYC, Hamburg, Dubai, Hong Kong, San Francisco.

## 4. Client Base and Use Cases
- **Private Equity (PE):** The core engine. PE firms use AlphaSights for "commercial due diligence" (CDD) before buying companies. These calls are high-stakes, high-rate, and require rapid turnaround.
- **Strategy Consulting:** McKinsey, Bain, BCG (MBB) are heavy users. They need experts to validate hypotheses for their end-clients.
- **Hedge Funds / Asset Management:** Use experts for public market signal checks.
- **Corporate Strategy:** Growing segment, but less dominant than PE/Consulting.
- **Use Case:** "deal flow" research. Experts are often called when a client is about to spend $100M+ on an acquisition and needs to verify technical or market claims in 48 hours.

## 5. Engagement Types and Workflow
- **1:1 Phone Consultations:** 90% of the volume. Standard 60-minute calls.
- **Project-Based Work:** Occasional longer-term advisory, but rare compared to calls.
- **Surveys:** Growing, but less spammy than GLG/Guidepoint. Targeted B2B surveys.
- **Workflow:**
    1.  Associate finds you (LinkedIn/Database).
    2.  **Vetting Call:** A 10-15 min phone call with the Associate (NOT the client) to "screen" you. **Critical Step.**
    3.  Profile submission to Client.
    4.  Client selection.
    5.  Scheduling & Compliance.
    6.  The Call.
    7.  Payment.

## 6. Registration and Onboarding Realities
- **Inbound vs. Outbound:** You can register on their website, but 80%+ of projects start with them finding *you* (Outbound).
- **The "Vetting Call":** unlike GLG (often automated), AlphaSights almost always requires a quick chat with a junior associate to verify your background before presenting you to the client.
- **Registration:** `https://www.alphasights.com/experts/`
- **LinkedIn is Key:** Their associates live on LinkedIn Recruiter. Your LinkedIn profile *is* your application.
- **No Cost:** Free to join.

## 7. Rate Intelligence (All Reported Ranges)
### 7.1 Reported Rate Ranges
- **Standard Offer:** Associates often suggest $150-$300/hr initially to test your floor.
- **Realized "Pro" Rate:** Experienced experts typically land $500 - $800/hr.
- **Executive/Niche Rate:** C-level or rare technical niche (e.g., specific drug development, obscure industrial control systems) can command $1,000 - $1,500/hr.
- **Repo Data Points:**
    - `REDDIT_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY_2025.md`: "AlphaSights associates have a budget, they try to keep the spread. Push for $500."
    - `CODEX_MEDIUM_10K.md`: "Don't get out of bed for less than $400 on AlphaSights."

### 7.2 The "Margin" Reality
- AlphaSights charges clients heavily ($1,000 - $2,000+ per call).
- Associates are incentivized on margins in some contexts, or at least on "successful delivery" within budget.
- There is usually $300-$500/hr of "slack" in their initial offer.

## 8. Rate Negotiation Playbook
- **The "Anchor" Move:** When an associate reaches out, they often ask "What is your standard hourly rate?".
- **Response:** "My standard commercial consulting rate is **$800/hr**." (Adjust based on seniority, but aim high).
- **The Pushback:** Associate: "Oh, the budget for this project is tighter, we usually see $300."
- **The Counter:** "I understand. However, for this specific topic where I have direct operational experience, I can't go below **$500/hr**. I can offer a 30-min pro-rated cap if the client isn't satisfied."
- **Leverage:** Speed. "I can take the call tomorrow morning at $500."
- **Don't Blink:** If you are the right expert, they will pay. They sell *access*, not price.
- **Retainer/Bulk:** Rare for single calls, but applicable if they want 5+ hours.

## 9. Payment Reliability and Timing
- **Reliability:** 10/10. Very corporate, very reliable.
- **Method:** Direct Deposit / Wire Transfer.
- **Timing:** Monthly or bi-monthly cycles. Usually net 15-30 days after month-end.
- **Currency:** Can pay in USD, GBP, EUR, etc.
- **Dashboard:** Clear visibility into pending and paid invoices.

## 10. Volume and Demand Signals
- **High Volume:** Top 3 global volume. If you are in a hot industry (Tech, Healthcare, Energy), expect frequent outreach.
- **Project Type:** Due diligence is cyclical. End of quarters and end of year are busy for PE deals.
- **Reactive:** You can't really "browse" projects. You must wait to be contacted.
- **"Hot" Topics 2025:** AI Infrastructure, GLP-1 Drugs, Private Credit, Defense Tech, Cybersecurity (Zero Trust/SASE).

## 11. Project Matching Algorithm (The "Human-in-the-Loop" Reality)
- Unlike algorithms that match keywords, AlphaSights relies on **Associates** (typically young, smart, hungry grads).
- **The Algorithm is a Person:** A 24-year-old Associate has a quota to fill 3 expert slots for a McKinsey team by 5 PM.
- **Implication:** You need to be **responsive** and **personable** to the associate.
- **The "Vetting" Script:** They will ask specific screening questions. Answer confidently. If you waffle, they move to the next name on the list.
- **Keyword Matching:** They search LinkedIn. Ensure your profile has the specific keywords (e.g., "Kubernetes," "Revenue Cycle Management," "Polymer manufacturing").

## 12. Screening Questionnaire Strategy
- AlphaSights often does **phone screening** rather than just text forms.
- **Tip:** Treat the Associate like a client. Sell your expertise to them. They are the gatekeeper.
- **Text Screeners:** If sent a written screener, keep it high-level.
    - *Bad:* "I increased revenue by 12% by changing X, Y, Z specific vendors." (You just gave the answer for free).
    - *Good:* "I led a revenue transformation project involving vendor consolidation. I can discuss the specific strategic levers and vendor landscape during the call."

## 13. Success Strategies: Profile Positioning
- **LinkedIn Headline:** Must be descriptive. "Former VP of Sales at Snowflake" is better than "Sales Leader."
- **Summary:** List specific software, machinery, regulations, or markets you know.
- **"Former" Roles:** Extremely valuable. PE firms want to talk to *former* employees to get the "real dirt" (within compliance limits) on a target company.
- **Consultant Profile:** If you have an AlphaSights profile, keep your bio updated with your latest projects.

## 14. Success Strategies: Responsiveness and Outreach
- **Speed is King:** AlphaSights promises clients "experts within hours."
- **The 15-Minute Rule:** Reply to an email/InMail within 15 minutes to increase your win rate by 50%.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Be ready to schedule calls from your phone.
- **Associate Relationship:** If you deliver a great call, the associate will tag you as a "Gold Star" expert and call you first next time.

## 15. Success Strategies: Rate and Commercial Discipline
- **Set Your Floor:** Decide "I won't do calls for less than $X." Stick to it.
- **Raise Rates Annually:** Increase your rate by $50-$100 every year or every 5 calls.
- **Contextual Pricing:** Charge more for "Niche/Hard" topics vs "General Industry" chat.
- **Cancellation Fees:** AlphaSights is usually good about paying if a client cancels < 24 hours (ask for it).

## 16. Success Strategies: Call Preparation
- **No Deck Needed:** 99% of calls are "conversation only." No slides.
- **Mental Prep:** Review the 3-4 screening questions. That's the agenda.
- **Environment:** Quiet room, good headset. PE clients get annoyed by background noise.
- **Compliance Check:** Remind yourself what you *cannot* say (MNPI, trade secrets).

## 17. Success Strategies: Call Execution
- **The "Answer First" Pyramid:** Start with the conclusion, then explain. Strategy consultants love this.
- **Be Honest about "I Don't Know":** It builds credibility. "I can't speak to the Asian market, but in North America..."
- **Guidance:** Don't lecture. Let the client drive the questions.
- **Time Management:** If the call hits 60 mins, say "I can continue if you need more time, or we can wrap up." (Gets you paid for overage).

## 18. Success Strategies: Post-Call and Scaling
- **Feedback:** Ask the associate "How did the client find the call?"
- **Referrals:** "I know someone else who knows about [X], would you like an intro?" (Referral fees are $100-$300).
- **Billing:** Submit invoice immediately via their portal.

## 19. Compliance and Risk Management
- **Strict:** AlphaSights has a very robust compliance framework.
- **Training:** You must pass their compliance tutorial.
- **MNPI (Material Non-Public Information):** strict prohibition.
- **Competitors:** You cannot consult on your current employer.
- **Public Companies:** Extra scrutiny if you work for a publicly traded firm.

## 20. Red Flags and Common Complaints
- **"Bait and Switch":** Associate offers $500, then comes back saying "Client budget is $300." (Hold firm).
- **Last Minute Cancellations:** Happens in M&A deals. Deal dies, call dies.
- **Aggressive Associates:** Some can be pushy about scheduling. Be firm with your boundaries.
- **Unpaid Vetting:** You don't get paid for the 15-min vetting call with the associate.

| Feature | AlphaSights | GLG |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 22. Role-Based Playbooks

- **The Technical Expert (Engineer/Dev):** Command $500+. Focus on "implementation reality" vs "sales brochure promises." Clients love hearing why a tech stack failed.
- **The Customer (Procurement/User):** Value is in "Why we bought X vs Y." Rate $300-$600.
- **The Competitor (Former Employee):** High value. "What is the culture? Sales incentive structure?" (Keep it compliant).
