## 1. Executive Summary

- Tegus is positioned as a buy-side focused expert network with a subscription model and a transcript library.
- Repo sources highlight a mixed profile: some of the highest rates in the market alongside severe payment and cancellation complaints.
- Reported rate medians cluster around $450/hr, with typical ranges in the $400-$600/hr band and high-end $800+/hr.
- Some sources cite entry-level rates as low as $100-$200/hr, emphasizing the need for negotiation.
- Tegus differentiates by enabling asynchronous written responses paid at the same rate as live calls.
- The transcript library creates commoditization risk: insights can be reused without residual payments.
- Sources disagree on acquisition price; repo documents cite both $930M and $4B for AlphaSense’s 2024 acquisition.
- Payment timing ranges from “15 business days” to “standard processing,” but multiple reports flag no-pay cancellations and partial payments.
- Calls are recorded and transcribed; transcripts are shared after a delay with expert names redacted.
- Strong fit for finance, TMT, SaaS, and investment due diligence topics; limited non-finance coverage is noted.
- Success strategies hinge on fast response, niche positioning, and careful control of what gets into the transcript library.
- Asynchronous work offers leverage, but experts should structure responses like mini-memos to maximize perceived value.
- Rate negotiation is critical: sources repeatedly advise anchoring high and rejecting default offers.
- Experts should explicitly confirm cancellation compensation and transcript terms before accepting engagements.
- Despite risks, Tegus can be a top-rate platform for experts comfortable with the subscription and transcript model.

## 3. Tegus Snapshot

### 3.1 Corporate Timeline

- 2016: Founded by former AlphaSights alumni (finance background).
- 2018: Relocated from San Francisco to Chicago (Midwest hub).
- 2024: Acquired by AlphaSense (repo sources cite $930M and $4B valuations).
- 2024: Price increases reported post-acquisition (client subscriptions and call pricing).

### 3.2 Market Positioning

- Buy-side focus: hedge funds, private equity, and asset managers are core clients.
- Subscription-based access to a growing transcript library of expert calls.
- Value proposition: faster access to investment-grade expert insights via searchable archives.
- Perception in repo sources: innovative model but limited non-finance coverage.

### 3.3 Client Profile & Industries

- Primary client base: hedge funds, PE firms, asset managers, corporates doing diligence.
- Industries served (from signup doc): Technology, Media & Telecom (TMT), Consumer, Energy, Life Sciences.
- Security consulting overlay: cloud security, SaaS metrics, vendor comparisons, AI/ML platform assessments.
- Industrial/OT examples: manufacturing security vendor selection deep dives (e.g., Dragos vs Nozomi).

## 4. Business Model & Client Economics

### 4.1 Subscription Model

- Tegus is subscription-based, not pure pay-per-call (core differentiator).
- Repo pricing signals: $20K-$25K per user per year plus ~$550 per published call (EXPERT_NETWORK_COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_2025.md).
- Client-side call pricing reported around $500-$600 per call, with other sources indicating $800-$1,200+ per hour.
- Subscription model creates strong incentives to build a reusable transcript library.

### 4.2 Transcript Library Mechanics

- Calls are recorded and transcribed; transcripts are shared after a delay (two-week delay noted in signup doc).
- Expert names are redacted in transcripts, but insights persist in the library.
- Library model fuels commoditization concerns (“selling your brain once”).
- Some sources describe passive exposure benefits, while others warn of zero residuals.

### 4.3 Expert Compensation Visibility

- Experts set their own rates (signup doc highlights this as a key differentiator).
- Rates are visible in expert profiles; clients see transparent pricing tiers.
- Calls are prorated to the nearest 15 minutes (signup doc).
- Payment within 15 business days is claimed in signup documentation.

### 4.4 Model Tradeoffs

- Strength: subscription model can yield high rates and repeat client exposure for experts.
- Risk: no residuals for transcripts accessed by multiple clients.
- Risk: cancellation policies and partial payment complaints are more severe than peers.
- Decision: experts must weigh high hourly rates against transcript commoditization.

- Ability to craft higher-quality, structured responses.
- Written answers create reusable personal knowledge artifacts.
- No travel or call logistics; easier to batch multiple requests.
- Same rate as synchronous calls in cited sources.

### 8.3 Risks and Limitations

- Written responses become part of the transcript library.
- Higher risk of over-sharing because answers are documented verbatim.
- No opportunity to clarify misunderstood questions in real time.
- Potential for partial payment if response scope exceeds allotted time.

### 8.4 Recommended Writing Format (Mini-Memo)

- 1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences).
- 2. Key data points (bulleted, with ranges or directional trends).
- 3. Decision drivers (top 3 factors that move outcomes).
- 4. Risks & unknowns (where assumptions could break).
- 5. Metrics to watch (KPIs or benchmarks).
- 6. Suggested next questions (3-5 follow-ups).

### 8.5 Asynchronous Response Checklist (Quality Control)

- Confirm the question scope in one sentence before answering.
- State the timeframe of your experience (e.g., 2022-2024).
- Separate facts from opinion explicitly.
- Quantify ranges instead of single-point estimates.
- Include competitive context when relevant.
- Highlight assumptions that drive your conclusions.
- Avoid confidential or proprietary information from current employer.
- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists for scanning.
- Limit the response to the agreed time cap (avoid free work).
- Close with 2-3 “if helpful, we can cover” topics.
- Proofread for clarity; transcripts persist in the library.
- Remove internal jargon unless it’s industry-standard.
- Include caveats if data is directional or anecdotal.
- Check for compliance conflicts before submitting.
- Keep a personal copy for future reference and consistency.

## 9. Tegus Success Strategy Playbook

### 9.1 Positioning for Buy-Side Clients

- Frame expertise around investment decisions, not just operational execution.
- Highlight how your insights affect revenue, margin, or risk in a diligence context.
- Use language like “market sizing,” “unit economics,” “competitive moat,” and “switching costs.”
- Anchor your profile to roles with decision authority (VP, Director, C-level).
- Emphasize former employer credibility without revealing proprietary details.

### 9.2 Profile and Keyword Optimization

- Associates scan profiles in ~10 seconds; keep statements crisp and specific.
- Use keyword clusters (e.g., “SaaS metrics,” “cloud security,” “TMT,” “AI/ML platform”).
- List specific vendors, products, and frameworks you have firsthand experience with.
- Update profile after each relevant project to keep recency signals strong.
- Avoid generic job descriptions; focus on insights you can provide.

### 9.3 Rate Negotiation Framework

- Default rates are often low; repo guidance recommends anchoring high and negotiating down.
- Use the “double rule”: if offered $200, counter at $400 and settle at $300.
- Reference market data: clients often pay $800-$1,200+/hour while experts receive a fraction.
- Set your Tegus rate consistently with other networks to avoid discounting.
- Re-evaluate rates quarterly, especially after strong feedback or repeat requests.

### 9.4 Call Delivery Tactics

- Lead with high-level framing, then drill into specifics.
- Provide 2-3 structured takeaways early to build client confidence.
- Offer decision-ready insights rather than generic commentary.
- Share tradeoffs, not just recommendations, to demonstrate credibility.
- Keep compliance boundaries explicit when topics touch sensitive info.
- Avoid long monologues; keep answers concise and pointed for transcript clarity.

### 9.5 Transcript-Aware Strategy

- Assume every word becomes a reusable asset in the library.
- Avoid sharing novel frameworks you plan to monetize elsewhere.
- Provide evergreen insights that stay accurate for 12-24 months.
- Clarify what you cannot discuss; compliance-safe boundaries protect future work.
- Structure answers so a transcript reader can follow without call context.

### 9.6 Compliance Guardrails

- Never disclose material non-public information (MNPI).
- Avoid discussing current employer confidential processes or pricing.
- Decline any request for documents, internal decks, or customer lists.
- State when your experience is historical or outside the last 24 months.
- If a question crosses lines, redirect to high-level industry observations.
