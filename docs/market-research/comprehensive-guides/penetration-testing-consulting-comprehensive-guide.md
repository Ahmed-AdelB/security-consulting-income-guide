### Income Variables & Risk Factors

#### Positive Income Factors

- **Geography**: DC/SF/NYC = 10-25% premiums
- **Specialization**: ICS, blockchain, medical = 20-40% premiums
- **Certifications**: OSCP/OSCE3 = 15-30% higher rates
- **Reputation**: Published CVEs, talks = ability to charge premium
- **Contract Type**: Government/FedRAMP = higher rates but longer sales cycles

#### Negative Income Factors

- **Market Saturation**: Competitive regions = price pressure
- **Economic Downturn**: Pentest often first budget cut (not compliance-driven)
- **No Specialization**: Commodity pentesting = low margins
- **Client Concentration**: Losing 1 of 3 clients = 33% revenue drop
- **Platform Dependence**: Algorithm changes can reduce work volume

#### Expense Considerations

**Solo Consultant Annual Expenses:**

- **Tools & Software**: $3,000-8,000 (Burp Suite Pro, VPN, cloud labs, licenses)
- **Insurance (E&O)**: $1,500-4,000
- **Certifications & Training**: $2,000-8,000 (OSCP renewal, new certs, conferences)
- **Marketing**: $2,000-6,000 (website, SEO, ads)
- **Business Admin**: $1,000-3,000 (accounting, legal, software)
- **Hardware**: $1,000-3,000 (laptop refresh, testing devices)
- **Taxes**: 25-35% of net income (self-employment tax, federal, state)

**Total Overhead**: 20-35% of gross revenue (varies by business model)

---
