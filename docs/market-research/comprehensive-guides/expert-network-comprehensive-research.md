## TIPS FOR MAXIMIZING INCOME

### 1. Speed & Responsiveness (CRITICAL)

- **24-48 Hour Window**: Most decisions happen within first 24-48 hours of project posting
- **Set up notifications** for all expert network emails
- **Respond within hours**, not days - timing more important than most realize
- Late responses significantly reduce selection chances even with strong qualifications

### 2. Optimize Your Profile

- **Different from resume/LinkedIn**: Focus on what you KNOW, not what you CAN DO
- **Associates spend 10 seconds** scanning profiles - make it SIMPLE
- **Recent & specific** beats broad & dated
- **Use keywords** - AI-powered selection increasingly common in 2025
- **Update regularly** with current experience

### 3. Strategic Pricing

- **Start competitive**: $150-$300 for new consultants, $300-$500 for experienced
- **Test higher rates** after building reviews: $500-$750
- **Elite credentials** justify $1,000+ (former CEO, book author, TedX speaker, unique expertise)
- **Don't undersell**: Clients pay $1,000-$1,500+ to networks; your $300 becomes their $1,200
- **GLG caveat**: Hard to change rates later, set carefully initially
- **Remember value**: Portfolio managers making million-dollar decisions will pay for quality

### 4. Multiple Networks Strategy

- **Register on 3-5 networks** minimum
- **Top combinations**: GLG + AlphaSights + Dialectica + Guidepoint
- **Avoid relying on single platform** - work is "feast or famine" everywhere
- **Keep rates consistent** across networks (market is efficient)

### 5. During Calls - Maximize Value

- **Go off-script**: Clients appreciate insights they haven't considered
- **Don't be afraid to disagree**: They pay premium for honest expertise, not yes-men
- **Brief explanations + examples** work best
- **Focus on recent, firsthand experience**
- **Be honest about limitations** - builds trust for future calls

### 6. Build Reputation

- **First calls critical**: Good reviews lead to more opportunities
- **Be selective**: Better to decline than underperform
- **Stick to expertise**: Don't stretch background for more projects
- **Consistency matters**: Associates trained to spot inconsistencies

### 7. Tax Planning

- **Track all income**: You'll receive 1099 if over $600/year
- **Set aside 25-30%** for taxes (self-employment + income tax)
- **Document expenses**: Home office, internet, phone can be deductible
- **Consider quarterly payments** if earning $1,000+/quarter

### 8. Realistic Earnings Expectations

- **Typical**: $3,000-$6,000/year with a few networks at $250/hour
- **Active**: $10,000-$20,000/year with multiple networks and good reputation
- **Elite**: $50,000+/year if in-demand niche with premium rates
- **Time investment**: A few hours per month to 5-10 hours/month
- **Remember**: "Feast or famine" - some months zero, some months $5K+

### 9. Platform-Specific Strategies

- **GLG**: Set high initial rate (hard to change), respond to surveys for steady income
- **AlphaSights**: Build to $500+/hour after initial calls, emphasize speed
- **Dialectica**: Start $150, confidence-build to $300-$500, patient 10-day payment
- **Guidepoint**: Be selective with questionnaires, negotiate after success
- **Avoid**: Maven (payment issues), Tegus (cancellation policies)

### 10. Long-term Positioning

- **Develop niche**: Specialized expertise commands premium (cybersecurity, AI/ML, biotech)
- **Stay current**: Recent experience (last 2-3 years) most valuable
- **Build speaking profile**: TedX, conferences, publications boost credibility
- **Consider IANS Faculty**: Cybersecurity experts may prefer exclusive faculty model

**Realistic Goal**: With 3-4 networks, good profile, $300-$500/hour rates, and responsive behavior, earning $5,000-$15,000/year working 10-20 hours total is achievable.

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### For Choosing Platforms

**CRITICAL - Avoid These Platforms:**

1. **Tegus** (2.3/5 rating)
   - No payment if client cancels (even after 15 min wait)
   - Partial payments: "Only half agreed amount"
   - Public transcripts erode competitive advantage
   - High project cancellation with no compensation

2. **Maven** (Payment issues)
   - Payment delays lasting months
   - Clawbacks: Taking back already-paid money
   - Survey scams: Complete survey, deemed "unqualified," no pay
   - "Zero consults in whole year with 50+ survey invites"

3. **Lynk Answers/Global** (NOT in main 10, but research found)
   - 60-75 working days payment timeline
   - Experts unpaid for 2-3 years reported
   - "Scam company" reviews
   - Consider legal action discussions

**Caution - Use with Awareness:** 4. **Atheneum**

- 4+ week payment delays (chronic)
- "Above average payment complaints"
- Some consultants never paid
- Good platform otherwise, if you can tolerate delays

5. **Guidepoint**
   - Only pay for call time (not waiting time)
   - Long questionnaires, many don't convert
   - Payment delay reports
   - Low Trustpilot (3.2/5) vs. competitors

### Behavioral Red Flags

**Expert Behaviors That Get You Flagged/Banned:**

1. **Misrepresenting experience** - AI compliance monitoring scans calls
2. **Sharing non-public/insider information** - immediate removal
3. **Inconsistencies** between LinkedIn, profile, screener answers
4. **Underperforming** - networks stop sending projects
5. **Stretching background** beyond actual expertise
6. **Long-winded responses** in screeners - keep to 1-2 sentences
7. **Slow responses** - projects filled in 24-48 hours

**Platform Behaviors to Watch:**

1. **Aggressive recruiting** - if outreach feels scam-like (AlphaSights complaint)
2. **Rate pressure** - associates trying to lower your rate (Third Bridge)
3. **Project spam** - frequent off-topic requests (Dialectica complaint)
4. **Unclear payment terms** - if not crystal clear, get in writing
5. **No screening call compensation** - standard but be aware
6. **High client cancellation rates** - Tegus issue

### Compliance Red Flags - DO NOT CROSS THESE LINES

1. **Never discuss current employer** proprietary information
2. **Never consult for competitors** of current employer
3. **Never share non-public information** (material non-public info = insider trading)
4. **Respect confidentiality** of clients and projects
5. **Follow network compliance training** - taken seriously post-scandals
6. **Document employer approval** if required by your contract

**IRS Red Flags (Tax Compliance):**

1. **Unreported 1099 income** - networks report to IRS
2. **Aggressive deductions** without documentation
3. **Mixing personal/business expenses** without clear records
4. **Not making quarterly payments** if earning $1,000+/quarter

### Client/Project Red Flags

1. **Vague project descriptions** - may indicate fishing expedition
2. **Pressure to share** specific company information
3. **Questions about confidential** processes or data
4. **Requests for documents** or materials (almost always prohibited)
5. **Unclear scope** - nail down time commitment before accepting

### Warning Signs - When to Walk Away

- Platform asks you to **work for free** (Lynk tried "donation" suggestion)
- **Payment terms change** after work completed (Tegus partial payment)
- **No written agreement** on compensation
- **Pressure to lower rate** excessively (Third Bridge associate behavior)
- **Client questions cross compliance lines** - end call immediately
- **Platform has criminal/regulatory issues** - research background

### Protect Yourself

1. **Screenshot all rate agreements** before calls
2. **Document completion** of calls/surveys
3. **Track all payments** and follow up on delays beyond stated timeline
4. **Save all communications** for at least 3 years (tax records)
5. **Review platform terms** quarterly (they change)
6. **Join expert forums** for real-time issue sharing
7. **Report violations** to network compliance teams
8. **Consider liability insurance** if doing high-volume consulting

**Bottom Line**: Stick to established platforms (GLG, AlphaSights, Dialectica, Guidepoint), avoid those with payment issues (Maven, Tegus), respond quickly, price appropriately, stay compliant, and don't rely on any single platform.
