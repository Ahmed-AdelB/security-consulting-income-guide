## 5. Income Models & Pricing Mechanics

### 5.1 Hourly / Time‑and‑Materials

- Best for: unclear scope, discovery, incident response, platform audits.
- Use **rate bands** from Section 4; add premiums for urgency or compliance scope.

### 5.2 Fixed‑Scope Project

- Best for: assessments, pipeline integrations, single tool rollouts.
- Derived pricing formula: `(estimated hours × hourly rate) × 1.1‑1.25 contingency`.
- Use a **change‑order clause** for new repos, new cloud accounts, or added compliance requirements.

### 5.3 Retainer / Advisory

- Internal benchmarks: **$2k‑$10k/month**; vCISO **$5k‑$20k/month**.
- Retainer is ideal for **continuous vulnerability management**, **pipeline guardrails**, and **release‑security governance**.
- Avoid “all‑you‑can‑eat” retains; define SLAs and monthly hours.

### 5.4 Fractional DevSecOps Lead

- Combine **strategic oversight** with **hands‑on pipeline work**.
- Typical structure: 8‑20 hours/month plus a quarterly roadmap update.

### 5.5 Outcome / Value‑Based Pricing

- Appropriate for **cost‑reduction projects** (tool consolidation, pipeline speed improvements).
- Define baselines (build time, false positives, vulnerability aging) before pricing.

### 5.6 Hybrid Model (Recommended)

- **Phase 1:** Paid discovery (fixed)
- **Phase 2:** Implementation (fixed + change orders)
- **Phase 3:** Retainer for continuous assurance

**Value anchors:** Position pricing against avoided incident costs, reduced audit prep time, and faster release cycles. When clients understand the business impact, they are more willing to pay for senior expertise and continuous support. Use baseline metrics to demonstrate improvement and reinforce the value of the ongoing retainer.

### 6.8 DevSecOps Maturity Model (Practical)

**Level 0 — Ad hoc:** Security checks are manual, release approvals are inconsistent, and visibility is post‑deployment. The pipeline has little to no automated scanning, and issues are handled reactively.

**Level 1 — Basic Automation:** A handful of repositories run SAST or dependency scans. There is limited coverage and high false‑positive volume, and triage is largely manual.

**Level 2 — Standardized Pipelines:** Shared CI/CD templates exist with baseline security stages. Coverage is measured and dashboards exist for tracking vulnerabilities and scan completion.

**Level 3 — Policy‑Driven:** Policy‑as‑code introduces consistent guardrails (branch protections, merge checks, quality gates). Evidence collection for compliance is automated, and security SLAs are defined.

**Level 4 — Continuous Assurance:** Risk scoring is integrated into release decisioning. Findings aging and remediation efficiency are tracked. Release approvals incorporate severity thresholds.

**Level 5 — Optimized & Predictive:** Security controls self‑tune for noise reduction. Threat intelligence and risk trends inform pipeline policies, and metrics drive proactive vulnerability prevention.

### 6.9 Roles & Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

| Activity | Security Lead | Platform/DevOps | App Engineering | Compliance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pipeline security architecture | A/R | R | C | I |
| SAST/DAST tool selection | A/R | C | C | I |
| Policy‑as‑code enforcement | A | R | C | I |
| Secrets management workflows | A | R | C | I |
| Dependency vulnerability triage | A | C | R | I |
| IaC security scanning | A | R | C | I |
| Container/K8s runtime policy | A | R | C | I |

## 25. Appendix L: Policy Templates & Snippets

### L.1 Release Gate Policy (Example)

All production releases must meet security gate criteria prior to deployment. Security gates include:

- SAST scan completed with no unresolved critical findings.
- Dependency scan completed with no unresolved critical CVEs.
- Secrets scan completed with zero confirmed secrets.
- Required approvals completed by code owners and security lead.

Exceptions require documented risk acceptance with an expiration date not exceeding 30 days. Emergency releases must complete a retrospective review within 5 business days.

### L.2 Vulnerability SLA Policy

| Severity | SLA | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 7 days | Fix or apply compensating control |
| High | 30 days | Fix or documented risk acceptance |
| Medium | 90 days | Fix or schedule with roadmap |
| Low | 180 days | Fix when feasible |

### L.3 Risk Acceptance Template

- **Risk ID:**
- **Description:**
- **Severity:**
- **Business justification:**
- **Compensating controls:**
- **Owner:**
- **Approval date:**
- **Expiration date:**
- **Review frequency:**

### L.4 Security Exception Policy

Security exceptions are granted only when remediation is not feasible within SLA windows. Exceptions must include mitigation steps and an expiration date. All exceptions require approval from the security lead and the relevant engineering manager.

### L.5 Evidence Retention Policy

Security evidence generated by pipeline scans and approvals must be retained for a minimum of 12 months (or longer if required by compliance frameworks). Evidence should be stored in a controlled repository with audit‑ready access logs.

### L.6 Dependency Governance Policy

All third‑party dependencies must be reviewed for licensing and vulnerability risk prior to production use. Critical or high vulnerabilities require remediation or documented risk acceptance before release. Approved dependency lists should be reviewed quarterly.

---

## 26. Appendix M: ROI & Cost‑Savings Model

### M.1 Core ROI Drivers

- **Reduced vulnerability remediation cost:** Fixing issues earlier reduces downstream rework.
- **Fewer release delays:** Automated gating reduces ad‑hoc approvals.
- **Audit efficiency:** Automated evidence collection reduces manual compliance effort.
- **Incident reduction:** Fewer high‑severity vulnerabilities lower breach risk.

### M.2 Baseline vs. Improved Scenario

**Baseline assumptions:**

- 20 engineering teams
- 40 critical/high vulnerabilities per quarter
- Average remediation cost per issue: $2,000
- 2 delayed releases per quarter due to security findings
- Audit prep cost: $50,000 per year

**Post‑DevSecOps assumptions:**

- 40% reduction in critical/high findings
- 50% reduction in release delays
- 60% reduction in audit prep cost

**Annual savings estimate:**

- Vulnerability remediation: 40 × $2,000 × 4 quarters = $320,000 baseline
- Savings at 40% reduction = $128,000
- Release delay reduction: assume $10,000 per delay × 4 = $40,000; 50% reduction → $20,000 savings
- Audit prep savings: $50,000 × 60% = $30,000
- **Total estimated savings:** ~$178,000/year

### M.3 Payback Period Calculation

If annual DevSecOps consulting spend is $120,000 and savings are $178,000, the payback period is under 12 months with a net annual benefit of ~$58,000.

### M.4 ROI Formula (Template)

`ROI = (Annual savings − Annual program cost) ÷ Annual program cost`

Use this formula to communicate ROI to executives and to justify retainer renewals.

### M.5 Sensitivity Analysis (Quick Guide)

Run a sensitivity analysis to show how ROI changes with different assumptions:

- **Low‑impact case:** 20% vulnerability reduction and 20% audit savings.
- **Base case:** 40% vulnerability reduction and 60% audit savings.
- **High‑impact case:** 60% vulnerability reduction and 80% audit savings.

For each case, vary the assumed cost per vulnerability and the number of releases delayed per quarter. Present the range to leadership so expectations remain realistic and aligned to operational realities. This helps reinforce the value of continuous improvement and validates why a retainer model is more sustainable than one‑off projects.

- Set baselines during discovery and update monthly.
- Use rolling 30‑day averages to smooth noise.
- Align metrics to business outcomes (release speed, risk).
- Report to engineering weekly and executives monthly.
- Retire metrics that do not drive action.

### P.7 Target Benchmarks & Alert Thresholds

- **Coverage targets:** 80% in 60 days, 95% in 6 months for Tier‑1 repos.
- **Critical MTTR:** <30 days for internet‑facing services.
- **False positives:** keep below 20% to preserve developer trust.
- **Release gate override rate:** <5% per quarter.
- **Risk acceptance backlog:** no exceptions older than 90 days.

Use alert thresholds to trigger escalation when metrics trend in the wrong direction. For example, if critical MTTR exceeds 45 days for two consecutive months, escalate to engineering leadership and reprioritize backlog.

### P.8 Dashboard Design Tips

- Keep executive views focused on trend lines and risk reduction.
- Provide drill‑downs for engineering teams by repo and service.
- Highlight “top five” blockers rather than all findings.
- Use color consistently for severity and SLA status.
- Refresh dashboards on a predictable cadence (weekly or monthly).

### Q.2 Module Descriptions

**Module 1 — DevSecOps Strategy & Metrics**

Focus on aligning security goals with business outcomes. Participants define the top three risks, success metrics, and acceptable trade‑offs between security and velocity.

**Module 2 — Secure Pipeline Architecture**

Participants map their CI/CD flow and identify ideal insertion points for security scans, approvals, and artifact controls. Emphasis is placed on minimizing pipeline friction.

**Module 3 — Code & Dependency Security**

Deep dive into SAST and dependency scanning. The module addresses false positives, triage workflows, and the difference between advisory vs. gating findings.

**Module 4 — Secrets & Credential Hygiene**

Covers detection, rotation, and response processes for exposed credentials, along with developer education practices and escalation paths.

**Module 5 — IaC & Cloud Guardrails**

Explores infrastructure scanning, policy‑as‑code for cloud misconfigurations, drift detection, and configuration baselines.

**Module 6 — Container & Runtime Security**

Discusses base image strategy, runtime policy enforcement, cluster hardening, and monitoring for privilege escalation.

**Module 7 — Compliance Evidence Automation**

Maps compliance controls to pipeline artifacts and demonstrates how to automate evidence capture and reporting for audits.

### Q.3 Hands‑On Labs (Optional)

- **Lab A:** Enable a SAST stage in a sample pipeline and tune findings.
- **Lab B:** Configure dependency scanning and define severity gating.
- **Lab C:** Add secret scanning and simulate a rotation workflow.
- **Lab D:** Implement policy‑as‑code rules for branch protection.
- **Lab E:** Generate an SBOM and tie it to release artifacts.

### Q.4 Outputs & Artifacts

- Documented maturity baseline and top risk themes.
- Agreed list of priority pipelines and repos.
- Draft security gate policy and exception workflow.
- Initial roadmap for 30‑60‑90 day implementation.
- Agreed metrics and reporting cadence.

### Q.5 Facilitator Notes & Best Practices

- Keep the workshop outcome‑focused; avoid deep tool debates without a decision framework.
- Use real pipeline screenshots or diagrams to ground discussions in current reality.
- Encourage engineering leaders to define “acceptable friction” for security gates.
- Validate that compliance requirements are understood before proposing evidence workflows.
- Align on top three metrics that matter to leadership before building dashboards.
- Capture decisions in a living document that can be referenced post‑workshop.
- Highlight quick wins to build momentum in the first 30 days.
- Assign owners for each action item during the session, not after.
- Reserve time for questions about developer enablement and training.
- Close with a commitment checklist so each stakeholder knows next steps.

### Q.6 Pre‑Work Checklist (Send 1–2 Weeks Before)

- Collect a list of Tier‑1 repositories and pipeline owners.
- Export current vulnerability metrics (critical/high counts, aging).
- Provide current CI/CD pipeline diagrams or architecture docs.
- Confirm existing security tooling licenses and expirations.
- Identify compliance frameworks in scope for the next 12 months.
- Gather recent incident or security post‑mortem summaries.
- Provide list of key engineering leads and security stakeholders.
- Share current onboarding documentation for new repositories.
- Compile existing security policies or standards.
