## Executive Summary
In 2025, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) have evolved from compliance checkboxes to strategic imperatives. The convergence of escalating cyber threats (ransomware), supply chain volatility, and strict regulatory enforcement has driven a robust market for resilience expertise. Organizations are moving beyond static PDF plans to dynamic, tested, and automated recovery capabilities.

**Key Insight:** The "Resilience Architect" is emerging as a premium role, blending traditional BCP with cyber recovery and cloud resilience, commanding higher rates than traditional "planner" roles.

---

## Market Landscape & Demand Drivers
The global market for BCDR solutions and services is projected to grow significantly (CAGR ~8-12%), driven by:

1.  **Ransomware as a Disaster:** Cyberattacks are now the primary driver for DR invocation. Traditional "fire and flood" DR is insufficient; "cyber recovery" vaults and immutable backups are in high demand.
2.  **Regulatory Pressure:**
    -   **Finance:** DORA (EU), SEC rules (US).
    -   **Healthcare:** HIPAA security rule updates.
    -   **Critical Infrastructure:** CIRCIA (US).
3.  **Digital Dependency:** Zero tolerance for downtime in cloud-native and always-on digital services.
4.  **Supply Chain Fragility:** Global disruptions have forced companies to map and mitigate 3rd and 4th party risks.
