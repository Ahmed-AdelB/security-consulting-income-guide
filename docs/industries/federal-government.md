## Appendix T: Federal Contract Types & Pricing Models

Federal security consulting engagements are typically executed under a small set of contract types. Understanding how each model impacts rates, delivery risk, and reporting effort is critical when scoping federal work.

### Time & Materials (T&M)

- **Best for:** Staffing‑heavy roles, variable scope, short‑term support.
- **Pricing:** Rates are tied to approved labor categories and capped by contract terms.
- **Risk:** Client pays for time; contractor bears utilization and staffing risks.
- **Key controls:** Timesheet accuracy, role‑to‑labor‑category alignment, rate compliance.

### Firm Fixed Price (FFP)

- **Best for:** Clearly defined deliverables and stable scope.
- **Pricing:** Fixed total fee based on estimated labor and overhead.
- **Risk:** Contractor absorbs scope creep and delivery risk.
- **Key controls:** Strong change management, clear acceptance criteria, scoped deliverables.

### Cost Plus (CPFF/CPIF)

- **Best for:** R&D, uncertainty in requirements, innovative or evolving scope.
- **Pricing:** Reimbursable costs plus fee; requires detailed cost reporting.
- **Risk:** High reporting and audit burden, lower margin flexibility.
- **Key controls:** Cost tracking, approved cost pools, compliance with cost principles.

### IDIQ Task Orders

- **Best for:** Long‑term programs with recurring needs.
- **Pricing:** Task order‑level pricing (T&M or FFP) within a master contract.
- **Risk:** Competitive task orders require continuous capture effort.
- **Key controls:** Maintain responsiveness to task order requests and pricing updates.

### Pricing Mechanics by Contract Type

- **T&M:** Focus on labor category accuracy, rate justification, and utilization.
- **FFP:** Use detailed work breakdown structure, milestone‑based payments, and schedule buffers.
- **CPFF/CPIF:** Build robust cost accounting and transparency for government audits.

### Rate Escalation and Option Years

- Include a standard escalation assumption (often 2–5% annually).
- Ensure escalation aligns with labor market pressures and clearance premiums.
- Document the escalation policy in pricing narratives.

### Example Pricing Structures

- **SETA staffing:** T&M with fixed labor categories; predictable revenue.
- **RMF package:** FFP with defined deliverables and a change request process.
- **FedRAMP readiness:** Hybrid model (FFP for documentation + T&M for remediation support).

### Negotiation & Compliance Tips

- **Anchor on labor categories:** Map every resume to a labor category with clear years of experience and certifications.
- **Document rate rationale:** Use internal salary benchmarks, clearance premiums, and scarcity to justify pricing.
- **Clarify ODCs and travel:** Ensure the proposal explicitly states what is included vs. billed separately.
- **Avoid under‑pricing:** Federal contracts can lock rates for option years; low initial rates can erode margins later.
- **Align deliverables to acceptance criteria:** Especially for FFP, tie payment milestones to completed artifacts.
- **Track compliance obligations:** Verify contract terms related to sales reporting, audit support, and data handling.

These practices reduce negotiation friction and protect margins while maintaining compliance with federal procurement standards.

- Transition to steady‑state monitoring cadence
- Quarterly risk reviews and control validation
- Update documentation for system changes
- Plan for next authorization cycle or re‑assessment

### Monthly Operational Cadence (Sample)

- Patch management review and verification
- Vulnerability scan execution and remediation tracking
- POA&M updates and risk register review
- Incident response log review and tabletop exercise scheduling

### Quarterly Cadence (Sample)

- Control testing for high‑impact controls
- Access reviews and privileged account verification
- Backup and recovery test validation
- Configuration management baseline review

### Governance Cadence & Stakeholder Touchpoints

- **Weekly delivery sync:** Review progress on open tasks, blockers, and staffing changes.
- **Biweekly technical review:** Validate control implementation status with system owners.
- **Monthly compliance review:** Update POA&Ms, risk register, and evidence repository.
- **Quarterly executive briefing:** Provide AO/CISO summary of posture changes and risks.

### Sample Metrics to Track

- Percentage of controls implemented and validated
- Number of open POA&M items by severity
- Vulnerability remediation SLA performance
- Evidence completeness score for audit readiness
- Incident response mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond (MTTR)

### Communication Best Practices

- Use consistent report templates to reduce stakeholder fatigue.
- Provide risk narratives alongside metrics (why a metric moved).
- Track decisions and action items in a shared governance log.
- Make all deliverable approvals explicit in meeting notes.

## Appendix AD: Risk Register & Mitigation Playbook

The risk register below captures recurring threats to delivery, compliance, and profitability in federal security engagements. Use it to align mitigation actions with proposal commitments.

| Risk | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clearance delays | New hires waiting on clearance sponsorship | Schedule slip, delivery gaps | Pre‑identify cleared bench, partner with primes |
| Scope creep | Additional systems added post‑award | Margin erosion, delivery risk | Strict change control, scope baseline |
| Access delays | Delays in account provisioning or facility access | Idle staff time | Pre‑award access plan, early onboarding |
| Tool approval lag | Security tools require approval before use | Assessment delays | Obtain tool whitelisting early |
| Data handling non‑compliance | Mismanaged CUI or sensitive data | Contract penalties | Mandatory training and audits |
| Staffing attrition | Cleared staff churn | Delivery instability | Retention incentives, bench planning |
| Documentation backlog | Evidence library not kept current | Audit failures | Weekly evidence collection cadence |
| Dependency on subcontractors | Subs fail to deliver | Quality risk | Strong flow‑down requirements |
| Underestimated remediation | Control fixes larger than expected | Cost overruns | Pre‑assessment gap analysis |
| Unclear acceptance criteria | Deliverables rejected by agency | Rework and delays | Align acceptance criteria in SOW |

### Delivery Risk Mitigations

- **Clearance pipeline:** Maintain a clearance tracker and identify backup candidates.
- **Scope discipline:** Use a scope matrix and change request workflow.
- **Resource planning:** Maintain a 10–15% bench capacity for surge tasks.
- **Documentation cadence:** Weekly evidence capture reduces end‑of‑project backlog.

### Compliance Risk Mitigations

- Require annual CUI handling refresher training.
- Use standardized artifact naming conventions.
- Conduct quarterly internal audits to validate evidence completeness.

### Financial Risk Mitigations

- Track burn rate weekly; adjust staffing for utilization.
- Use milestone payments in fixed‑price engagements.
- Incorporate escalation clauses for multi‑year contracts.

### Risk Scoring Rubric (Simple)

- **Likelihood (1‑5):** 1 = rare, 5 = almost certain.
- **Impact (1‑5):** 1 = minimal, 5 = mission‑critical failure.
- **Score:** Likelihood × Impact (range 1–25).
- **Thresholds:** 1–6 = low, 7–12 = medium, 13–19 = high, 20–25 = critical.

### Escalation Triggers

- Any critical score (20–25) requires immediate stakeholder notification.
- Two consecutive months of high scores for the same risk triggers a corrective action plan.
- Any risk that affects compliance milestones should be escalated to the AO or PMO.

### Monthly Risk Review Agenda

1. Review new risks and assign owners.
2. Validate status of high and critical risks.
3. Confirm mitigation effectiveness and update action plans.
4. Align risks to upcoming deliverables and compliance deadlines.

### Mitigation Playbook by Risk Type

- **Clearance delays:** Maintain a bench of cleared subcontractors; secure LOIs for surge support.
- **Tool approvals:** Pre‑submit tool whitelisting requests during kickoff; use agency‑approved tools as fallback.
- **Scope creep:** Tie all changes to contract clauses and require written approval.
- **Documentation backlog:** Assign a dedicated compliance coordinator to manage evidence capture.
- **Access issues:** Use onboarding checklists and sponsor accounts before start dates.
