## Real Consultant Earnings Scenarios

Earnings are highly variable and not guaranteed.
The examples below are illustrative and use simple math.
All amounts are gross and do not include taxes or expenses.

### Scenario A: Occasional Expert

- 2 calls per month
- 45 minutes per call
- 200 USD per hour
- Monthly gross: 2 * 0.75 * 200 = 300 USD
- Annual gross: 3,600 USD

### Scenario B: Active Expert

- 6 calls per month
- 60 minutes per call
- 300 USD per hour
- Monthly gross: 6 * 1.0 * 300 = 1,800 USD
- Annual gross: 21,600 USD

### Scenario C: High-Demand Expert

- 10 calls per month
- 60 minutes per call
- 500 USD per hour
- Monthly gross: 10 * 1.0 * 500 = 5,000 USD
- Annual gross: 60,000 USD

### Scenario D: Top-Tier Executive

- 6 calls per month
- 45 minutes per call
- 900 USD per hour
- Monthly gross: 6 * 0.75 * 900 = 4,050 USD
- Annual gross: 48,600 USD

### Scenario E: Mixed Workload with Surveys

- 4 calls per month at 300 USD per hour
- 6 surveys per month at 35 USD each
- Monthly gross: (4 * 1.0 * 300) + (6 * 35) = 1,410 USD

### Managing Cancellations and No-Shows
