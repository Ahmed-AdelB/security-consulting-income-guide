## 1. Executive Summary

Boards are increasingly expected to oversee cybersecurity risk as a core enterprise issue. Regulatory regimes now require structured cyber risk governance, incident disclosure, and documented oversight. As a result, boards are competing for directors who bring operational cybersecurity leadership, breach response experience, and regulatory fluency. This competition has created a measurable **cybersecurity expertise premium** in director recruitment and compensation design.

**Key takeaways (directional):**

- **Public company board compensation** typically concentrates in a mix of cash retainer, equity/RSU awards, and committee fees. Directionally, total annual compensation ranges from **~$150k–$350k** depending on market cap and industry. Cyber experts can command **10–30% incremental value** in role design, committee leadership, or additional retainers.
- **Private and PE‑backed boards** commonly pay **~$50k–$150k** with some portion of equity or carried interest; VC‑backed startups skew lower cash and higher equity (often **0.1–1.0%** at early stages).
- **Advisory board and security advisory panel** rates typically range from **$5k–$50k annually** in cash retainers with per‑meeting fees of **$1k–$5k**, or hourly/project rates in the **$200–$800+** range for senior practitioners.
- **Premiums are justified** by heightened incident risk, regulator expectations, insurance scrutiny, and the board’s duty of care. However, **independence and conflicts** must be carefully managed, especially when advisors have ongoing consulting relationships.

This dossier provides a structured compensation framework, directional ranges, and a practical playbook to design or negotiate cybersecurity board roles. It includes templates, scorecards, and a validation roadmap to move from directional estimates to audited benchmarks.

## 3. Why Cybersecurity Expertise Commands a Board Premium

### Structural Drivers

1. **Regulatory Requirements**
   - Formal cyber risk disclosures and oversight expectations in public markets.
   - Sector‑specific regimes: financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure.
2. **Insurance and Underwriting Scrutiny**
   - Cyber insurers increasingly demand board‑level oversight evidence.
3. **Incident Frequency and Severity**
   - Ransomware and supply‑chain compromises impact enterprise value.
4. **Operational Complexity**
   - Cloud, SaaS, zero‑trust, and AI create new board‑level risk vectors.
5. **Talent Scarcity**
   - Qualified cyber leaders with governance experience are limited.

### How Boards Use Cyber Experts

- **Risk Oversight:** Translate technical risk into governance decisions.
- **Incident Oversight:** Guide breach response, disclosure, and recovery.
- **Investment Prioritization:** Evaluate security ROI and program maturity.
- **Third‑Party Risk:** Evaluate supply‑chain dependencies.
- **Strategic Alignment:** Integrate cyber risk with growth and M&A strategies.
