---
## 2. Retention mindset and core principles
- Retention is a consequence of perceived momentum.
- Clients stay when value is visible and predictable.
- Every deliverable needs a narrative, not just output.
- Build trust with consistent, low-drama communication.
- Protect your time by saying no to low-fit work early.
- Renewals are earned over months, not during month twelve.
- Create a habit of proof, not a habit of promises.
- Retention is multi-threaded, not single-stakeholder.
- Reduce surprise and increase shared visibility.
- The client is buying outcomes, not effort.

### Retention principles checklist
- Deliver a quick win inside the first 30 days.
- Create a shared roadmap that updates monthly.
- Tie all work to a business metric.
- Escalate risks early with solutions, not blame.
- Maintain a documented log of impact.
- Teach the client to explain your value to others.
- Always confirm what success looks like, in their words.
- Use plain language summaries after every significant milestone.

---
## 3. The retention equation
- Retention = Perceived value x Relationship depth x Momentum.
- Perceived value is proof of outcomes and progress.
- Relationship depth is the number of people who trust you.
- Momentum is the cadence of visible improvement.
- Any variable going to zero collapses retention.
- One month of silence reduces confidence exponentially.
- Strong relationships without value still lead to churn.
- Great value with no champions still risks cancellation.

### Retention equation diagnostics
- Score perceived value from 1 to 10 with your champion.
- Count active stakeholders who attend meetings or read updates.
- Review how many days since last visible deliverable.
- Identify the weakest variable and fix it first.

### Value proof categories
- Revenue growth or pipeline growth.
- Cost reduction or efficiency gains.
- Risk reduction or compliance improvement.
- Customer experience improvement.
- Capability building or skill transfer.
- Strategic clarity or decision velocity.
