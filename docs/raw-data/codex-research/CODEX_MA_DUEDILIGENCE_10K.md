# M&A Cybersecurity Due Diligence Research (Security Consulting Rates for Acquisitions)

## Scope, methodology, and limitations
This report is a long-form, desk-based synthesis of how cybersecurity due diligence is scoped, delivered, and priced in mergers and acquisitions. It consolidates common consulting approaches, typical deliverables, and directional rate ranges used to budget buy-side and sell-side diligence. The goal is to help corporate development teams, private equity firms, and security leaders align on scope, timing, and cost drivers.

Important limitations apply: this document does not use live web browsing or real-time market data. Rate ranges are indicative planning ranges rather than verified quotes, and should be validated through competitive bids and legal review. Use the material as a structured starting point, then calibrate with current proposals, regional labor conditions, and industry-specific constraints.

> Note: This is not legal, financial, or insurance advice. It is a practical guide for scoping and budgeting cyber due diligence engagements.

## Executive summary
- Cybersecurity due diligence is often compressed into 2–6 weeks, making scope clarity the most important driver of success.
- Pricing is primarily driven by deal size, depth of testing, regulatory exposure, and speed-to-close rather than by a single universal rate.
- Most engagements blend document review, management interviews, and targeted technical testing; deeper testing increases cost but reduces integration risk.
- Common deliverables include a red-flag memo, a prioritized risk register, remediation cost estimates, and a 100-day integration plan.
- Indicative hourly rates for M&A cyber diligence typically range from $150–$350 for independent consultants, $250–$600 for mid-tier firms, and $400–$900+ for global firms, with blended team rates often lower.
- Sell-side diligence can reduce surprises and shorten the buyer’s diligence window, but independence and conflict-of-interest considerations matter.

## How to use this report
- Use the scope and workstream sections to build or validate a diligence request list.
- Use the depth tiers to align effort with deal timeline and risk tolerance.
- Use the rate and budget sections as directional inputs for an RFP or internal budget.
- Use the deliverables and red-flag sections to align on decision gates and escalation triggers.

## Market context and demand drivers
- **Regulatory exposure:** sector-specific requirements (financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure) increase scrutiny and diligence depth.
- **Cyber insurance pressure:** insurers and lenders increasingly ask for diligence artifacts and control maturity evidence.
- **Cloud and SaaS sprawl:** distributed architectures and third-party dependencies require more technical validation.
- **Incident visibility:** breach history and vulnerability disclosure practices materially affect valuation and integration planning.
- **Investor expectations:** private equity and strategic acquirers expect a quantified view of cyber risk in investment committee memos.

## Where cybersecurity due diligence fits in the M&A lifecycle
Cyber due diligence runs in parallel with legal, financial, and operational diligence. It is commonly staged to match deal momentum.

1. **Target screening (pre-LOI):** lightweight external attack-surface review and public signals.
2. **LOI to confirmatory diligence:** data room review, interviews, and internal evidence analysis.
3. **Signing and close:** finalize red flags, closing conditions, and remediation commitments.
4. **Integration planning:** design the 30/60/90-day security integration roadmap.
5. **Post-close execution:** deliver on remediation, tool integration, and risk reduction initiatives.

## Transaction types and risk allocation

### Asset purchase
Risk is often limited to acquired assets, but legacy systems and shared services can be hidden. Cyber diligence focuses on the assets being carved out, transition service agreements, and data transfer risks.

### Stock purchase
The buyer inherits historical liabilities. Diligence must include incident history, regulatory exposure, and security control maturity across the entire entity.

### Carve-out or divestiture
Complexity increases due to shared infrastructure and interdependencies. Diligence must map what stays, what moves, and what is rebuilt.

### Minority investment or joint venture
Governance and control rights determine how much visibility is achievable. Diligence often focuses on board-level risk oversight and contractual rights.

### Distressed or turnaround deals
Security maturity may be low; risk tolerance must be explicit. Diligence typically emphasizes critical controls, ransomware exposure, and business continuity.

## Stakeholder map and decision rights
- **Corporate development / PE deal team:** owns scope, timeline, and go/no-go decisions.
- **CISO / security lead:** validates control maturity, interprets technical findings, and advises on remediation costs.
- **IT leadership:** confirms system inventories, access dependencies, and integration feasibility.
- **Legal / compliance:** aligns on regulatory exposure, privacy liabilities, and contract language.
- **Finance:** translates remediation and insurance costs into valuation adjustments.
- **Risk management / insurance:** evaluates coverage gaps and exclusions.
- **Integration management office:** plans Day-1 and 100-day security integration initiatives.

## Core diligence workstreams

| Workstream | Key Questions | Typical Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Governance and program maturity | Is there a formal security program with clear ownership and budget? | Policies, org charts, risk registers, security budget summaries |
| Asset inventory and CMDB | Are systems, data flows, and cloud accounts fully inventoried? | CMDB exports, cloud account lists, architecture diagrams |
| Identity and access management | Are privileged accounts controlled and monitored? | IAM policies, MFA coverage reports, PAM configurations |
| Network and endpoint security | Is the environment segmented and monitored? | Network diagrams, EDR coverage reports, firewall policies |
| Cloud security posture | Are cloud configurations aligned to best practices? | CSPM reports, IAM role reviews, logging configurations |
| Application security and SDLC | Are applications tested and patched consistently? | SDL policies, SAST/DAST results, code review evidence |
| Data protection and privacy | Is sensitive data classified and encrypted? | Data classification, encryption settings, DLP policies |
| Incident history and response | Have there been material incidents or regulatory notifications? | IR plans, incident logs, post-incident reports |
| Third-party and supply-chain risk | Are critical vendors assessed and monitored? | Vendor risk assessments, contracts, SOC reports |
| Compliance and regulatory | Are obligations met and validated? | SOC 2/ISO reports, PCI/HIPAA evidence, audit reports |
| Business continuity and resilience | Are backups and recovery tested? | BCDR plans, RTO/RPO metrics, backup test logs |
| Physical and OT (if applicable) | Are facilities and OT environments secured? | Facility access logs, OT network diagrams, safety controls |

## Evidence sources and data room checklist
Evidence review is typically anchored in a data room and targeted interviews. The list below covers common artifacts requested in buy-side diligence.

- Security policies, standards, and control frameworks.
- Organizational charts, security team roster, and budget summaries.
- Asset inventory, network diagrams, and cloud account list.
- IAM and privileged access policies, MFA coverage, and access review evidence.
- Vulnerability management process, scan summaries, and remediation metrics.
- Application security program documentation and code review cadence.
- Incident response plan, tabletop exercises, incident history, and regulatory notifications.
- Backup, recovery, and business continuity plans with test evidence.
- Third-party risk assessments, key vendor contracts, and subprocessor lists.
- Recent audit reports, certifications, and compliance artifacts.
- Data classification scheme, encryption strategy, and privacy impact assessments.
- Security awareness training materials and completion rates.
- Bug bounty or external security testing reports.

## Diligence depth levels (tiers)
Aligning the depth of diligence with the deal timeline reduces friction and ensures the right questions are asked.

| Tier | Description | Typical Duration | Typical Effort | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 0 | Rapid red-flag scan (external footprint + high-level review) | 3–7 days | 20–40 hours | Early screening, small deals, time pressure |
| Tier 1 | Standard diligence (docs + interviews + limited technical review) | 2–4 weeks | 80–200 hours | Most mid-market acquisitions |
| Tier 2 | Deep diligence (Tier 1 + targeted testing + architecture review) | 4–8 weeks | 200–500 hours | Regulated industries, higher risk deals |
| Tier 3 | Full-scope diligence (Tier 2 + code review, segmentation validation, integration planning) | 6–12 weeks | 400–800+ hours | Large or highly regulated transactions |

## Technical testing options and safe bounds
Technical testing is often the most sensitive part of due diligence. It must be explicitly authorized and coordinated to avoid operational disruption.

- **External attack-surface review:** internet-facing assets, DNS, certificate hygiene, and exposed services.
- **Credentialed vulnerability scans:** internal systems review with agreed safe windows.
- **Configuration reviews:** firewall rules, cloud IAM, logging, and endpoint controls.
- **Cloud security posture analysis:** CSPM results, permission boundaries, data exposure checks.
- **Application security review:** high-level SDLC review or targeted code analysis for critical applications.
- **Penetration testing (scoped):** highly controlled test of critical systems.
- **Red/purple team exercises:** rare during diligence, typically reserved for post-close or pre-close with explicit approval.
- **Data protection validation:** encryption, key management, and access controls for sensitive data.

## Deliverables and outputs

## Risk rating, materiality, and valuation impact
Cyber diligence findings matter most when they translate into financial or operational exposure. Effective reporting classifies issues by materiality and recommends a corresponding deal action.

**Typical risk tiers and actions:**
- **Critical (deal breaker or closing condition):** unresolved breach, systemic access control failure, or regulatory noncompliance with imminent enforcement.
- **High (valuation or indemnity impact):** significant control gaps, weak vulnerability management, or missing incident response capability.
- **Medium (integration plan impact):** patching delays, limited monitoring coverage, or incomplete policies.
- **Low (operational hygiene):** documentation inconsistencies or minor tooling gaps.

**Common valuation levers:**
- Purchase price adjustments or escrow holdbacks.
- Specific indemnities or warranties related to cyber incidents.
- Pre-close remediation commitments with evidence milestones.
- Insurance premium adjustments or exclusions.
- Integration budget increases for remediation and tooling.

## Pricing structures and rate drivers

### Common pricing models
- **Time and materials (T&M):** most common for uncertain scope.
- **Fixed fee:** suitable when deliverables and timelines are well-defined.
- **Hybrid:** fixed fee for baseline diligence with T&M for out-of-scope testing.
- **Retainer or advisory:** used for ongoing pre-LOI screening across multiple targets.

### Key rate drivers
- **Deal size and risk tolerance:** higher valuations often demand deeper diligence.
- **Industry regulation:** healthcare, finance, and critical infrastructure demand more evidence.
- **Data sensitivity:** PII, PHI, payment data, or IP-heavy products increase scope.
- **Access and data room quality:** limited access increases effort and uncertainty.
- **Historical incidents:** breach history adds investigative work and legal coordination.
- **Infrastructure complexity:** multi-cloud, legacy systems, or global footprints add effort.
- **Timeline urgency:** accelerated diligence commands premiums.
- **Testing depth:** code review or penetration testing increases cost.

- **High incident history:** requires forensic review and legal coordination.
- **Legacy systems:** increase remediation effort and integration risk.
- **Aggressive timelines:** increase staffing and drive premium pricing.

## Timeline and resourcing assumptions
Below is a representative 4–6 week timeline for a Tier 1–2 diligence engagement.

- **Week 1:** kickoff, data room access, initial questionnaires.
- **Week 2:** document review, stakeholder interviews, early red flags.
- **Week 3:** targeted technical testing, validation of controls.
- **Week 4:** risk scoring, remediation estimation, draft report.
- **Week 5–6 (if needed):** integration planning, management Q&A, final report.

## Scoping questionnaire (buyer-side)
Use these questions to align stakeholders on scope and expectations.

- What is the deal type (asset, stock, carve-out) and expected close date?
- What is the target’s revenue, employee count, and data sensitivity profile?
- What are the critical products and systems that drive valuation?

## Budget estimation model (quick calculator)
Use this approach to sanity-check quotes.

1. **Select a base tier:** Tier 0 (20–40 hrs), Tier 1 (80–200 hrs), Tier 2 (200–500 hrs).
2. **Add complexity factors:** multi-cloud (+20–40%), regulated industry (+20–60%), global footprint (+15–40%).
3. **Add testing components:** pen test or code review (+50–150 hrs each).
4. **Apply blended rate:** weighted average of lead and analyst rates.
5. **Add contingency:** 10–20% for scope shifts or data delays.

**Example formula:**

```
Estimated hours = Base tier hours * (1 + complexity modifiers) + testing hours
Project cost = Estimated hours * blended rate + fixed testing add-ons
```
