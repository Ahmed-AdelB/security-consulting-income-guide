## 1. Executive Summary

Gerson Lehrman Group (GLG) is the progenitor and undisputed heavyweight champion of the expert network industry. Founded in 1998, it established the model of connecting institutional investors and strategy consultants with subject matter experts for hourly consultations. For cybersecurity professionals, GLG represents the highest volume and potentially highest reliable income stream in the "micro-consulting" sector.

Unlike freelance platforms (Upwork, Toptal) where deliverables are code or architecture, GLG creates value through **knowledge transfer**. You are paid for your perspective, your experience, and your ability to validate or debunk investment theses.

**Key Metrics for Cyber Professionals:**
*   **Potential Hourly Rate:** $300 - $1,500+ (function of seniority and niche).
*   **Project Volume:** High (Market leader in deal flow).
*   **Effort:** Low (No deliverables, strictly advisory calls).
*   **Prestige:** High (GLG membership is a standard resume accolades).

This guide serves as the definitive manual for navigating GLG, from the initial application to negotiating top-tier rates and managing a high-volume consultation pipeline.

## 2. The GLG Ecosystem: Understanding the Behemoth

To succeed on GLG, you must understand its position in the market. It is not just a database; it is a compliance and logistics engine powering the world's financial decisions.

### 2.1 Market Dominance
GLG boasts a network of over 1 million council members (experts) and serves thousands of clients, including:
*   **Hedge Funds:** Looking for "edge" on public tech companies (e.g., "Is CrowdStrike's new module gaining traction vs. SentinelOne?").
*   **Private Equity (PE):** conducting due diligence on potential acquisitions (e.g., "Assess the technical debt of this mid-market MSP").
*   **Strategy Consulting Firms:** (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) needing rapid industry immersion for their cases.
*   **Corporations:** seeking benchmarking data or vendor selection advice.

### 2.2 The "Knowledge Broker" Model
GLG does not produce research itself. It brokers *access*.
1.  **The Client** has a specific question ("What is the churn rate for Splunk customers migrating to cloud?").
2.  **The Associate** (GLG employee) searches the database for experts matching specific keywords (Splunk, SIEM, Cloud Migration).
3.  **The Council Member** (You) receives an invitation.
4.  **The Match** occurs, a call is scheduled, and knowledge is transferred.
5.  **The Payment** is processed, with GLG taking a significant margin (often 60-70%) on top of your rate.

**Crucial Insight:** GLG's markup is irrelevant to you. If you charge $1,000/hr, the client might pay $2,500/hr. The client does not care about the markup; they care about the *value* of the answer. Do not underprice yourself out of misplaced sympathy for a hedge fund.

## 3. The GLG Council Structure

GLG segments its experts into "Councils" based on industry. Cybersecurity professionals typically fall into the **Technology, Media, & Telecom (TMT)** Council, though overlap exists with **Legal, Economic & Regulatory Affairs** depending on the topic (e.g., SEC disclosure rules).

### 3.1 Membership Tiers
While GLG is opaque about internal tiers, functional tiers exist based on activity and exclusivity:

1.  **Standard Council Member:**
    *   The entry point.
    *   Access to general project board.
    *   Reactive workflow (waiting for invites).
    *   *Income Potential:* $5k - $20k / year.

2.  **GLG Member (Active/Preferred):**
    *   Consistent high ratings (4.5/5+).
    *   Quick response times.
    *   Often requested by name by repeat clients.
    *   *Income Potential:* $20k - $50k / year.

3.  **Key Opinion Leader (KOL) / Featured Speaker:**
    *   Invited to host roundtables, webcasts, or teleconferences.
    *   Featured in GLG Library content.
    *   Often involves travel (expenses paid) for client meetings (pre-COVID, now often virtual).
    *   *Income Potential:* $50k - $100k+ / year.

### 3.2 Surveys vs. Consultations
*   **Consultations (1:1 Calls):** The bread and butter. High hourly rate.
*   **Surveys (B2B Panels):** Lower payout ($40 - $100 flat fee). Good for maintaining "active" status and algorithm visibility, but low ROI on time.
*   **Projects/Placements:** Longer-term advisory roles, interim executive spots. Rare but lucrative.

## 4. The Application & Onboarding Masterclass

You cannot just "sign up" and expect calls. The onboarding is a sales pitch where YOU are the product.

### 4.1 The Profile "Hook"
Your GLG biography is not a resume. It is a **marketing brochure**.
*   **Bad Bio:** "Cybersecurity professional with 15 years experience in network security and GRC."
*   **Good Bio:** "CISO-level strategist and Architect specializing in Zero Trust migrations, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), and SecOps automation. Deep technical expertise in Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler, and CrowdStrike deployments for Fortune 500 financial institutions. Former regulator interaction experience."

### 4.2 Keyword Stuffing (The Right Way)
GLG Associates use Boolean search strings. If your profile lacks the keywords, you don't exist.
*   **Vendors:** List every tool you have administered, bought, or replaced. (e.g., Okta, Ping Identity, CyberArk, SailPoint).
*   **Trends:** SASE, XDR, CNAPP, SBOM, Post-Quantum Cryptography.
*   **Actions:** "Vendor Selection," "Contract Negotiation," "Implementation," "Migration."

### 4.3 The "Conflicts" Check
During onboarding, you will define your "Do Not Discuss" list.
*   **Current Employer:** You generally cannot discuss your current employer in detail to investors. This is standard.
*   **Public Companies:** If you work for a public company, restrictions are tighter.
*   **Competitors:** Be clear if you have non-competes.

**Strategy:** Be honest but specific. "I cannot discuss internal strategy of [My Current Employer], but I can discuss general industry trends, former employers, and technologies I use as a customer."

## 5. Rate Dynamics: Commanding $500 - $1,500+ Per Hour

This is the most critical section. Most consultants underprice themselves.

### 5.1 The Psychology of Pricing
Clients equate **Price** with **Quality**.
*   $100/hr = Junior Analyst / Support Tech.
*   $300/hr = Mid-level Manager / Engineer.
*   $500/hr = Director / Senior Architect.
*   $1,000/hr = CISO / VP / Niche Subject Matter Expert.

If a hedge fund wants to know if they should invest $50M into a cybersecurity startup, they do not want the $200/hr opinion. They want the $1,000/hr opinion because it implies you know things others don't.

### 5.2 Setting Your Initial Rate
*   **Guidance:** Do not start below $300/hr, even if you are junior.
*   **Recommended Starting Point (5+ years exp):** $500/hr.
*   **Recommended Starting Point (10+ years exp):** $700/hr.
*   **Recommended Starting Point (Exec/C-Suite):** $1,000/hr+.

### 5.3 Negotiating Upwards
GLG Associates have budget caps, but they are soft caps.
*   **Scenario:** You set $800/hr. Associate emails: "The client budget is capped at $500/hr. Can you lower your rate?"
*   **Response:** "I typically charge $800 given the specificity of this topic. I can do $500 for a 30-minute intro call, but for a full deep dive, I'd need to stick to $800. Let me know what works."
*   **Result:** 60% of the time, they find the budget. 40% of the time, they accept the 30-min compromise (which often turns into 60 mins at full rate once the client realizes you are good).

### 5.4 The "Prorated" Trap
GLG pays by the minute after the first X minutes.
*   Ensure you understand the billing increments.
*   If a call runs 15 minutes over, you get paid for that 15 minutes.
*   **Pro Tip:** If the client says "I have one last question" at the 59-minute mark, answer it. It pushes you into the next billing block.

## 6. Client Archetypes & Project Varieties

Understanding who is on the other end of the phone changes how you answer.

### 6.1 The Hedge Fund Analyst (The "Model Builder")
*   **Goal:** Validating a specific data point in an Excel model.
*   **Question Style:** Rapid fire, quantitative. "How much did you spend on Splunk vs. Datadog? What was the % increase in renewal? What is the seat cost?"
*   **Your Role:** Provide hard data (estimates are fine, but be specific). Don't waffle.

### 6.2 The Management Consultant (The "Learner")
*   **Goal:** Getting smart fast on an industry they know nothing about.
*   **Question Style:** Open-ended, frameworks. "Walk me through the purchase journey for an endpoint security solution. Who are the stakeholders?"
*   **Your Role:** Teacher/Professor. Structure your answer. "There are three phases: Discovery, POC, and Procurement..."

### 6.3 The Private Equity Principal (The "Judge")
*   **Goal:** Deciding whether to buy a company. Checking for "skeletons in the closet."
*   **Question Style:** Risk-focused. "Is this technology actually proprietary or is it just a wrapper around open source? What is the churn risk?"
*   **Your Role:** Auditor/detective. Be critical. PE firms love experts who kill bad deals (it saves them millions).

### 6.4 The Corporate Strategy Lead (The "Benchmarker")
*   **Goal:** Comparing their internal operations to peers.
*   **Question Style:** Operational. "How are other organizations structuring their SOC teams? How many Tier 1 analysts vs. Tier 2?"
*   **Your Role:** Peer advisor. Share "anonymized" war stories.

## 7. Operational Workflow: From Invite to Payment

### 7.1 The Invitation
You receive an email: "Consultation on Cybersecurity Trends."
*   **Action:** Click immediately. Speed matters.
*   **Screening Questions:** There will be 2-5 questions.
    *   *Do not write an essay.*
    *   *Do not say "Yes" or "See Bio".*
    *   **The Formula:** [Direct Answer] + [Context of Experience].
    *   *Q:* "Are you familiar with Zscaler?"
    *   *A:* "Yes. Managed a 5,000 seat deployment of ZIA/ZPA at a Fortune 500 retailer in 2023. Evaluated it against Netskope and Palo Alto Prisma."

### 7.2 The Scheduling
GLG has an automated scheduler.
*   **Calendar Sync:** Sync your Google/Outlook calendar.
*   **Availability:** Open up slots early morning (before work) and lunch hours.
*   **Time Zones:** Be aware of client locations (London/NY/Hong Kong).

### 7.3 The Call
*   **Dial-in:** Always use the provided conference line. It tracks time for billing.
*   **Introduction:** The standard compliance script is read (approx. 2 mins). This does NOT count against your paid time (usually), but be patient.
*   **The Meat:** Answer questions directly. If you don't know, say "I don't have visibility into that segment." Credibility > Speculation.
*   **The Wrap:** "Is there anything else I can help with?"

### 7.4 Payment
*   **Direct Deposit:** Set up ACH.
*   **Frequency:** Typically monthly or bi-weekly depending on region.
*   **Tax:** You receive a 1099 in the US. You are an independent contractor.

## 8. Compliance: The Ironclad Gatekeeper

Compliance is GLG's moat. It is why clients use them over LinkedIn cold outreach.

### 8.1 Material Non-Public Information (MNPI)
*   **The Golden Rule:** You cannot share information that is **not public** AND **material** (could move a stock price).
*   **Example (Bad):** "We are going to miss our Q3 earnings numbers by 20%." (MNPI - Jail time risk).
*   **Example (Good):** "Generally, I see softness in the retail sector demand for security tools this quarter." (Mosaic Theory - Safe).

### 8.2 The "Do Not Call" List
*   You cannot consult on your current employer.
*   You cannot consult on companies you left less than 6 months ago (sometimes 12).
*   You cannot consult if you are a government employee (usually).

### 8.3 The "Chaperone"
Sometimes, a GLG compliance officer sits on the line silently. They will cut the feed if MNPI is breached. This is rare but happens in high-sensitivity sectors (biotech/M&A).

## 9. Success Strategies: The Top 1% Playbook

How to move from $5k/year to $50k/year on GLG.

### 9.1 The "Trigger Finger" Response
*   GLG sends invites to 20 people. The client picks the first 3 good profiles they see.
*   **Tactic:** Answer screening questions within 15 minutes of receipt.

### 9.2 The "Value-Add" Reject
*   If you are rejected for a project, do not ghost.
*   **Tactic:** Reply to the Associate: "Understood. Keep me in mind if they need depth on [Related Niche Topic]. I also noticed you have a project on X, I'm a fit for that too."

### 9.3 Referral Loops
*   If you are too busy or not a fit, refer a colleague.
*   GLG pays referral bonuses ($100-$500).
*   It builds goodwill with the Associate.

### 9.4 Profile Gardening
*   Update your profile every 3 months.
*   Add new buzzwords. If "GenAI Security" is the hot topic, ensure it is in your bio.

## 12. The Future of GLG & Expert Networks

### 12.1 AI Disruption?
Will ChatGPT replace the expert?
*   **Analysis:** AI aggregates *past* public knowledge. It cannot tell you what a CISO is feeling *today* about a budget cut or a vendor relationship that hasn't hit the news.
*   **Prediction:** Low-level "industry 101" calls will vanish. High-level "sentiment and judgment" calls will increase in value.
*   **Impact on You:** You must move up the value chain. Stop selling facts; sell *judgment*.

### 12.2 Consolidation
The industry is consolidating. GLG remains the leader, but niche networks (Tegus, Stream) are eating the "transcript" market.
*   **Opportunity:** GLG is launching its own transcript library. You can get paid to have your interview recorded and sold repeatedly (royalties are rare, usually a higher one-time fee).

## 13. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I do this while employed full-time?**
A: Yes, 90% of experts are employed. Check your employment contract. Most allow "incidental consulting" that does not compete or interfere with work. Avoid calls during company time.

**Q: How do I get my first call?**
A: Lower your rate slightly ($300/hr) to get the first 3 "wins" and 5-star ratings. Then raise it aggressively.

**Q: What if the client is rude or the call is bad?**
A: Maintain professionalism. End the call if they push for MNPI. Report the behavior to the GLG compliance officer immediately. You will still be paid.

**Q: Does GLG demand exclusivity?**
A: No. Never sign an exclusivity agreement unless they are paying you a retainer (rare). Join all networks (AlphaSights, Guidepoint, Dialectica, Coleman).

**Q: Can I put "GLG Council Member" on my LinkedIn?**
A: Yes, it is a recognized credential. It signals you are an expert in your field.
