## 1. Executive Summary: The "Cyber Influencer" Economy

The cybersecurity niche on YouTube is one of the highest-paying verticals due to the "high-intent" nature of the audience (IT professionals, CISOs, developers). While generic YouTubers rely on volume, security creators monetize through **high CPMs ($15-$40+)** and **high-ticket B2B sponsorships**.

| Creator | Subscribers | Est. Ad Revenue (Annual) | Sponsorship Tier (Est.) | Primary Income Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NetworkChuck** | 4.5M+ | ~$365,000 - $500,000 | $20k - $50k / video | **Academy Subscription** ($12/mo) |

| **LiveOverflow** | 932K | Variable ($5k - $50k)** | $10k - $20k / video | **Sponsorships & Bounties** |

*\*Ad revenue estimates for Hammond vary wildly in public data; calculated potential based on view volume and niche CPM suggests significantly higher than generic tracker estimates.*

## 2. Creator Profiles & Income Breakdown

### A. NetworkChuck (The "Edutainer" Model)
*   **Subscribers:** 4.5M+
*   **Content Style:** High-energy, accessible, entry-level to mid-level IT/Networking.
*   **Monetization Strategy:**
    1.  **Ad Revenue:** Consistently high views (daily uploads/evergreen content). Est. **$1,000/day** ($365k/year).
    2.  **Sponsorships:** Major B2B players (Juniper Networks, ANY.RUN).
        *   **Rate Est:** **$20,000 - $50,000+** per dedicated integration.
    3.  **Own Product (The Cash Cow):** **NetworkChuck Academy**.
        *   Model: $12/month subscription.
        *   Value: Recurring revenue (MRR) likely dwarfs ad revenue. If only 0.5% of subs subscribe (22,500 users), that is **$270,000/month**.
    4.  **Affiliates:** Heavy use of Amazon Associates and software referral links.

### B. John Hammond (The "Industry Practitioner" Model)
*   **Subscribers:** 2M+
*   **Content Style:** CTF walkthroughs, malware analysis, news, practical hacking.
*   **Monetization Strategy:**
    1.  **Sponsorships:** The core revenue driver.
        *   **Partners:** Huntress (Employer - he is a Principal Security Researcher there, providing salary + equity), Brilliant, various security vendors.
        *   **Rate Est:** **$10,000 - $25,000** per integration.
    2.  **Training Platform:** **Just Hacking Training**.
        *   Model: Per-course sales and bundles. High-quality, low-cost training ($30-$50 range) aimed at mass adoption.
    3.  **Ad Revenue:** Lower than Chuck due to more technical/niche topics, but extremely high CPMs.
        *   *Analysis:* Public trackers estimate ~$1.5k/mo, but this likely ignores the "Tech/Security" CPM multiplier. A realistic floor is **$5k-$10k/mo** purely from ads if views are consistent.

        *   Strategy: Focuses on quality/prestige over daily grind.
    3.  **Bounties/CTFs:** Direct income from winning competitions and bug bounties.

## 3. 2025 Market Benchmarks: What You Can Charge

If you are entering this market, do not use "Gaming" or "Vlog" rates. Security is a **B2B vertical**.

### CPM & RPM (Ad Revenue)
*   **Generic YouTube CPM:** $2 - $5
*   **Tech/Security CPM:** **$15 - $40**
*   **Coding/Tutorial CPM:** **$40 - $100** (The "Holy Grail" of ad rates)
    *   *Why?* Advertisers (AWS, Google Cloud, Cybersecurity Vendors) have massive budgets and high customer lifetime value (LTV).

### Sponsorship Rate Card (Estimated)
*Rates assume high engagement and "US/UK/Canada" dominant audience.*

| Subscriber Tier | Rate Range (Per Video) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nano (1k - 10k)** | **$50 - $300** | Often "gifted" product or affiliate only. |
| **Micro (10k - 100k)** | **$500 - $5,000** | The "Sweet Spot" for niche vendors. |
| **Mid-Tier (100k - 500k)** | **$5,000 - $10,000** | Full time income territory. |
| **Macro (500k - 1M)** | **$10,000 - $20,000** | Agency representation common. |
| **Mega (1M+)** | **$20,000 - $100,000+** | Multi-video deals, brand ambassadorships. |

### Media Kit Essentials for Security Creators
To command these rates, your media kit must prove **Audience Quality** over Quantity.
1.  **Professional Demographics:** Show that your viewers are "System Administrators," "Developers," or "Security Analysts" (not just kids).
2.  **Geographic Lock:** % of audience in US/UK/EU (Tier 1 ad markets).
3.  **Engagement Rate:** Comments/Likes ratio (Security community is highly critical/engaged).

## 4. Key Takeaways for Your Strategy
1.  **Don't rely on Ads:** Even for John Hammond, ads are likely a secondary or tertiary income stream compared to his day job (Huntress) and sponsorships.
2.  **Build a Product:** NetworkChuck's wealth comes from his **Academy**. John Hammond is following suit with **Just Hacking**.
3.  **Target B2B Sponsors:** Security tools (SaaS, VPNs, VM platforms) pay significantly more than B2C products (games, snacks).
