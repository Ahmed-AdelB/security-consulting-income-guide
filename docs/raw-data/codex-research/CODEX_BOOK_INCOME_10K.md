# Security Book Writing Income Research (10K Draft)

> Note on methodology: This report was produced in an offline environment without live web access. It synthesizes general publishing practices and industry norms for technical books, then outlines what to verify directly with publishers, authors, and contracts. Treat all publisher-specific items as hypotheses to confirm.

## Executive Summary

- Traditional security books are usually a credibility play first and an income play second; meaningful revenue often comes from downstream services (consulting, training, speaking, or enterprise licensing).
- Advances in technical publishing are typically modest, recoupable against royalties, and vary widely by topic, author platform, and expected market size.
- Royalty calculations depend on the contract base (list price vs. net receipts), format (print vs. ebook vs. audio), and discount tiers; understanding the math is essential to modeling income.
- Security book sales are driven by adoption in professional workflows, certification alignment, and enterprise team use, not just retail visibility.
- Realistic income planning should include: writing time cost, advance timing, production schedule, and long-tail revenue over 3–5 years.
- For security topics, narrower, practitioner-oriented books often sell fewer units but can command higher pricing and stronger consulting conversion.
- Publisher choice (e.g., No Starch Press vs. Wiley) can affect format mix, pricing strategy, and marketing posture; verify their exact royalty bases and discount clauses.
- The author’s platform (mailing list, conference presence, employer endorsement, GitHub, training offerings) is one of the strongest predictors of deal terms and sales.
- Negotiation levers typically include: royalty base, ebook royalty percentage, discount thresholds, reversion terms, audio/translation rights, and marketing commitments.
- The best income outcomes generally combine a fair publishing contract with a deliberate post-launch revenue plan (training, bulk sales, and content licensing).

## 1. Scope and Definitions

This document focuses on **security book writing income** with a particular lens on **traditional publishers** and the two publishers requested by name: **No Starch Press** and **Wiley**. It also provides context from the broader technical publishing ecosystem because deal structures and royalties for security books follow common technical publishing patterns.

Key definitions:

- **Advance**: Upfront payment against future royalties; typically paid in tranches (e.g., signing, manuscript delivery, publication).
- **Royalty**: Percentage of revenue paid to the author based on a defined base (list price or net receipts).
- **Net receipts**: Revenue after discounts and certain costs; definitions vary by contract.
- **Earn-out**: When royalties exceed the advance, additional payments begin.
- **Escalators**: Higher royalty percentages triggered at sales milestones.
- **Subsidiary rights**: Additional revenue from translation, audio, excerpts, corporate licensing, and other derivative uses.

## 2. How Traditional Publishing Money Flows

### 2.1 Typical Contract Anatomy

Common clauses and how they affect income:

- **Grant of rights**: Defines territories, formats, languages, and digital rights. A broader grant may reduce your ability to negotiate separate income streams.
- **Advance schedule**: Determines when money arrives. Multi-tranche advances spread over 12–24 months reduce immediate cash flow.
- **Royalty base**: The most important income lever. Royalty on **list price** yields higher per-unit earnings than royalty on **net receipts**, but many contracts use net receipts.
- **Discount tiers**: If units are sold at deep discounts, your per-unit royalty often drops significantly.
- **Returns / reserves**: Publishers may hold back a portion of royalties to cover retail returns; this delays income recognition.
- **Reversion**: Determines when rights return to the author if sales fall below a threshold or the book goes out of print.
- **Option clause**: May require you to offer future works to the publisher, affecting your ability to shop better deals.

### 2.2 Royalty Bases Explained

Typical royalty bases for technical books include:

- **List price royalty**: A percentage of the book’s list price (e.g., 10–15% for print is common in technical publishing). This is generally favorable to authors.
- **Net receipts royalty**: A percentage of the publisher’s net receipts (often 20–30% for ebooks, sometimes 10–15% for print). This can be less favorable if heavy discounts are common.

Because security books often sell into institutional channels with discounts, understanding how those discounts reduce net receipts is critical.

### 2.3 Why Format Mix Matters

Income depends strongly on the ratio of print to ebook to audio sales. Security books often skew toward:

- **Print**: Preferred by some practitioners and organizations for team libraries or training settings.
- **Ebook**: Common in developer/security audiences; may be bundled with print or sold DRM-free by the publisher.
- **Audio**: Typically limited for highly technical content; not a major income source for most security books.

### 2.4 Advance Timing vs. Workload

Most authors underestimate the opportunity cost of writing. A rigorous plan should account for:

- 300–800 hours of writing and revision time for a 300–450 page technical book.
- Lost consulting hours or reduced billable time.
- The lag between acceptance, publication, and actual royalty reporting.

## 3. Security Book Market Dynamics

Security publishing has unique demand characteristics:

- **Rapid obsolescence**: Tools and techniques change quickly; books must focus on timeless mental models or assume frequent new editions.
- **Credentials and adoption**: Books aligned with popular certifications (CISSP, Security+, OSCP, cloud security) have predictable demand but face intense competition.
- **Team purchasing**: Many sales happen through corporate purchasing or education channels, which affects discount structures.
- **Audience mix**: Security books span beginners, practitioners, and advanced researchers. Each segment has different pricing tolerance and sales volume.
- **Trust and credibility**: Author credibility (industry experience, CVEs, conference talks) directly impacts sales and publisher interest.

### 3.1 Audience Segments and Income Implications

- **Beginner/entry-level**: Larger potential market, lower price tolerance; higher competition and more marketing effort.
- **Practitioner-focused**: Mid-size market, higher willingness to pay, strong consulting conversion potential.
- **Advanced/specialized**: Smaller market, premium pricing possible; strong indirect income but lower unit volume.

### 3.2 Topic Trends (General Observations)

Without live web data, trends should be validated directly, but common security publishing themes include:

- Cloud security and identity-centric architectures
- Secure software development and DevSecOps
- Threat modeling and secure architecture
- Incident response and DFIR
- Offensive security and testing methodologies
- Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)

## 4. Publisher Overview: No Starch Press and Wiley

The following sections describe each publisher in terms of **positioning and likely economic impacts**, with explicit prompts on what to verify. These are **not definitive contractual terms**.

### 4.1 No Starch Press (NSP)

**Positioning (generalized):**

- Independent publisher known for technical, hacker, and maker-focused titles.
- Brand often resonates with practitioners and hobbyist/pro audiences.
- Typically favors accessible, hands-on content with strong pedagogy.

**Potential income implications (hypotheses to verify):**

- Institutional sales channels can drive bulk purchases but at lower net receipts.
- They may offer structured marketing for certain imprints or series.

**What to verify directly with Wiley:**

- Royalty base and rate schedule by format.
- Escalators and their sales thresholds.
- Discount categories, including bulk and course adoption terms.
- Advance structure and delivery milestones.
- Rights retention options, especially for audio and translation.

### 4.3 Side-by-Side Verification Checklist (Publisher-Specific)

Use this as a questionnaire when evaluating NSP vs. Wiley (or any technical publisher):

- What is the **royalty base** for print and ebook (list vs. net)?
- Are **ebook royalties** based on net receipts or list price?
- How are **special sales** or **deep discounts** handled?
- Is there a **reserve against returns**, and how long?
- Are **escalators** available after certain sales levels?
- What is the **marketing plan**, and is it in writing?
- How are **subsidiary rights** handled (audio, translations, excerpts)?
- What is the **reversion** threshold for out-of-print or low-sales status?

## 5. Advances: Expectations and Variables

### 5.1 Industry-Norm Context (Generalized)

In technical publishing, advances are often modest compared to trade books. Common patterns observed across the industry (not publisher-specific) include:

- Advances often in the **low-to-mid five figures** for established authors or large-market topics.
- **Lower four-figure to low five-figure** advances for first-time or niche authors.
- Advances are almost always **recoupable** against royalties.

These are generalized patterns and should **not** be taken as specific to NSP or Wiley. Actual offers can be outside these bands.

### 5.2 Variables That Drive Advance Size

- **Author platform**: mailing list size, conference speaking history, existing online course sales.
- **Market size**: relevance to certifications, developer adoption, corporate training.
- **Competitive landscape**: number of recent books on the same topic.
- **Publisher fit**: if the topic aligns with an existing series or strategic initiative.
- **Co-authoring**: multiple authors can increase authority but split royalties.

### 5.3 Advance Payment Schedules

Typical schedules include:

- 1/3 on signing, 1/3 on manuscript delivery, 1/3 on publication.
- Some publishers use 1/4 or 1/5 splits to match milestones.

This schedule can be important if you are funding time off from consulting or employment.

## 6. Royalties: How to Model Income Accurately

### 6.1 Royalty Formula Overview

Basic print royalty calculation:

```
print_royalty = list_price * royalty_rate * units_sold
```

Ebook royalty calculation (net receipts model):

```
ebook_royalty = net_receipts_per_unit * ebook_rate * units_sold
```

Total royalty is the sum of all formats, minus any reserves or adjustments, until the advance is earned out.

### 6.2 Example Break-Even Calculation

```
units_to_earn_out = advance / (effective_royalty_per_unit)
```

Where `effective_royalty_per_unit` is a blended average across print and ebook formats.

### 6.3 Discount Effects

If 30–50% of sales are at heavy discounts, a net receipts model can cut effective royalties dramatically. Example (hypothetical):

- List price: $50
- Net receipts after 50% discount: $25
- Royalty rate: 25% of net receipts
- Effective royalty per unit: $6.25

Compare that to 10% of list price ($5.00) for print. Depending on the discount and rate, net receipts can be better or worse than list price royalties.

### 6.4 Escalators and Their Impact

Escalators can meaningfully improve long-tail income. For example, a contract might increase print royalties from 10% to 12.5% after 5,000 units. The incremental value is significant for a book with sustained sales.

## 7. Income Modeling Scenarios (Illustrative)

The following scenarios are **illustrative examples** using hypothetical numbers to show how different contract terms and sales volumes affect income. Replace with verified terms and your expected sales data.

### 7.1 Scenario Table (Hypothetical)

| Scenario | List Price | Units (Print) | Units (Ebook) | Royalty Basis | Royalty Rates | Gross Royalty | Net to Author (after 15% agent) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| A: Niche practitioner | $60 | 2,000 | 1,000 | Print list / Ebook net | 12% / 25% | $18,000 | $15,300 |
| B: Broad certification | $55 | 6,000 | 3,500 | Print net / Ebook net | 10% / 25% | $39,000 | $33,150 |
| C: Enterprise adoption | $65 | 10,000 | 4,000 | Print list / Ebook net | 12.5% / 25% | $78,250 | $66,512 |

These examples do **not** reflect any particular publisher’s actual contract terms. They demonstrate how a small change in royalty base or sales volume can radically change income outcomes.

### 7.2 Time-Adjusted Income

Most royalties are reported and paid semi-annually. When modeling cash flow:

- Spread income over 3–5 years.
- Assume delays of 6–12 months between sales and payment.
- Factor in return reserves.

### 7.3 Opportunity Cost Modeling

If writing takes 500 hours and your consulting rate is $150/hour, the opportunity cost is $75,000. A book can still be worthwhile if it drives long-term consulting and brand value.

## 8. Subrights and Ancillary Income Streams

### 8.1 Translation Rights

Security topics sometimes translate well to international markets. Translation rights can yield:

- Lump-sum fees for foreign editions
- Additional royalties in each territory

Whether these rights are retained by the author or handled by the publisher materially impacts income.

### 8.2 Audio Rights

Audio is often weak for technical content, but it can still be a modest long-tail revenue stream if retained.

### 8.3 Corporate Licensing and Bulk Sales

Security books can be sold in bulk to enterprise teams or as training materials. If you can drive bulk orders, negotiate better terms or separate licensing agreements.

### 8.4 Training, Courses, and Certification Alignment

High-income security authors typically leverage books as **lead generators** for:

- Paid courses
- Corporate workshops
- Conference keynote opportunities
- Consulting retainers

## 9. Marketing and Discoverability Strategies

### 9.1 Pre-Launch Strategy

- Build a mailing list and announce chapter previews or sample labs.
- Identify enterprise champions who will use the book as internal training.
- Align with relevant conferences (e.g., release around major security events).

### 9.2 Launch Strategy

- Coordinate publisher marketing with personal outreach.
- Use webinars or workshops to drive sales.
- Leverage open-source tools or labs referenced in the book.

### 9.3 Post-Launch Long Tail

- Release updates or companion resources.
- Offer enterprise licensing for additional materials.
- Collect feedback for new editions or follow-on books.

## 10. Negotiation Levers That Affect Income

Key contract points to negotiate:

- **Royalty base** (list price vs net receipts)
- **Ebook royalty rate** and discounts for bundles
- **Escalators** for high sales
- **Advance schedule** (faster milestone payments)
- **Rights reversion** thresholds
- **Discount clauses** and definitions of “special sales”
- **Non-compete and option clauses**
- **Marketing commitments** (even small commitments can matter)

Negotiation often matters more than the publisher’s brand in determining net income.
