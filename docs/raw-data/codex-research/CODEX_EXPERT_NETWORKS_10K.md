# Expert Networks Deep Dive (Reddit r/consulting + r/expertnetworks Extraction)

## Scope & Source Notes
- Compiled from existing repo research files that explicitly cite Reddit (r/consulting, r/expertnetworks) plus related forums (Trustpilot, Glassdoor, industry forums).
- No live web access in this environment; findings are limited to the sources listed below.
- Sources used: `REDDIT_EXPERT_NETWORK_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_2025.md`, `REDDIT_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY_2025.md`, `REAL_USER_EXPERIENCES.md`, `ULTRA_DEEP_REAL_USER_EXPERIENCES_SYNTHESIS_2025.md`.

## Cross-Platform Reddit Themes (Context)
- Negotiation impact: users who negotiate report ~40% higher rates; “rate cap myth” (GLG often claims $500 cap but approves $800+).
- Payment timing norms: fast 1–2 weeks, standard 2–3 weeks, slow 4–6 weeks; pro-rated-by-minute billing is common.
- Common complaints: unpaid screening surveys, rate pressure, project details changing after acceptance, cancellations/no-shows, payment delays, aggressive outreach.
- Commoditization concern: Tegus (and to a lesser extent Third Bridge) record calls for transcript libraries.
