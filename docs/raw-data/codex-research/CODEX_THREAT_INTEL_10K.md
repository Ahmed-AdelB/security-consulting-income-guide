## 1. Executive Summary

Threat intelligence consulting (also called cyber threat intelligence or CTI consulting) supports organizations by collecting, analyzing, and operationalizing information about adversaries, vulnerabilities, and risks. Unlike purely productized feeds or monitoring services, consulting engagements often combine tailored analysis, advisory guidance, and integration support to align intelligence with business priorities. Demand has grown as organizations face multi-stage ransomware, supply chain compromise, and geopolitical risk affecting operations and board-level decisions.

Key takeaways:

- CTI consulting typically spans strategic, operational, and tactical layers, often delivered via a hybrid of recurring reporting, on-demand analysis, and technical integration.
- Pricing varies widely by region, expertise, and provider type. Independent consultants commonly charge from $125–$350 per hour, boutiques from $175–$450 per hour, and large consultancies from $250–$600 per hour. Specialized or cleared work can exceed $700 per hour in certain markets.
- Monthly retainers for ongoing CTI advisory range broadly from $5k–$30k for small and mid-market buyers, $30k–$150k for large enterprises, and $150k+ for global or 24/7 intelligence operations.
- Fixed-scope projects (program buildout, threat landscape assessment, or TI integration) commonly range from $40k–$250k+, with delivery timelines from 4 to 16 weeks depending on complexity.
- Commercial CTI services are often a blend of consulting and subscription: basic platform access might run $10k–$60k per year, while enterprise intelligence programs including custom reporting, enrichment, and SLAs can exceed $250k–$1M per year.

This brief provides a 10K-level analysis of CTI consulting rates, delivery models, use cases, and procurement considerations, along with practical templates and guidance for buyers and providers.

## 2. Definitions and Scope of CTI Consulting

**Threat Intelligence (TI)** is the collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of information about threats, threat actors, vulnerabilities, and risk exposures. In a consulting context, CTI involves tailored advisory and operational support beyond commodity feeds.

**CTI Consulting** typically includes:

- **Strategic intelligence:** executive briefings, threat landscape analysis, geopolitical risk, and board-ready risk narratives.
- **Operational intelligence:** adversary campaigns, targeting analysis, sector-specific risks, and requirements-driven reporting.
- **Tactical/technical intelligence:** IOCs, TTP mapping, detection guidance, malware analysis, and incident support.
- **Program development:** building or maturing a CTI function, governance, and processes.
- **Integration and enablement:** aligning CTI output with SOC, IR, vulnerability management, and risk teams.

**CTI Services vs. CTI Products**

CTI products (feeds, platforms, TIPs) provide data and tooling; CTI consulting provides human expertise, contextual analysis, and operational alignment. Many vendors now blend both, offering platform access with consulting hours or research SLAs.

**What is “10K Research” in this context?**

This document provides a broad, in-depth synthesis (roughly 10k words) with actionable detail on consulting rates, service models, and procurement factors, designed as a reference for planning and decision-making.

## 21. Deep Dive: Pricing Structures and Negotiation Scenarios

### 21.1 Pricing structures in real-world CTI engagements

CTI consulting is priced in multiple ways because the service spans research, analysis, and operations. The model chosen typically reflects the buyer’s maturity and the predictability of demand.

- **Retainer with service credits**: A monthly fee that includes a fixed number of hours or deliverables. This is common when the client needs consistent reporting and analyst access.
- **Prepaid hours or block time**: A bank of hours used over 30–90 days. This suits organizations with periodic intelligence needs.
- **Deliverable-based pricing**: Fixed prices for specific outputs (e.g., threat landscape report, actor profile). Works well for one-off projects.
- **Per-seat or per-department pricing**: Common when consulting is bundled with a platform. Fees scale with usage or stakeholder count.
- **Incident-based pricing**: Used for surge support; often includes minimum hour blocks and expedited response premiums.

### 21.2 Example pricing scenarios

**Scenario A: Startup fintech**

- Monthly retainer: $9k
- Includes: one monthly strategic report, two ad hoc requests, and lightweight IOC validation.
- Ideal when a lean security team needs external analysis without building a full CTI function.

**Scenario B: Regional healthcare provider**

- Monthly retainer: $25k
- Includes: weekly threat briefing, quarterly executive report, and integration support for SIEM.
- Additional ad hoc requests billed at $225/hr.

**Scenario C: Global enterprise**

- Managed service: $180k per month
- Includes: 24/7 coverage, dedicated analysts, weekly and urgent reports, and integration with SOAR.
- Often paired with formal SLAs for response time and incident support.

### 21.3 Negotiation levers and trade-offs

Buyers can influence pricing by negotiating around scope and service guarantees.

- **Term length**: Longer commitments often reduce hourly rate.
- **Volume**: Pre-buying hours can reduce unit price.
- **Scope clarity**: Clear PIRs reduce rework and ambiguity costs.
- **Analyst access**: Reducing on-demand access lowers retainer size.
- **Geographic coverage**: Limiting regions or languages can reduce costs.

### 21.4 Pricing pitfalls to avoid

- **Overpaying for unused hours**: Ensure roll-over or clear usage plans.
- **Unclear deliverables**: Ambiguous scope often leads to unexpected change orders.
- **Bundled tooling**: Some vendors bundle feeds with consulting; confirm you need both.
- **Lack of SLA definitions**: Response-time ambiguity can lead to unmet expectations.

### 21.5 Benchmarking against internal costs

For many organizations, CTI consulting is still cheaper than building a full internal team. A single senior analyst can cost $160k–$250k annually (fully loaded), while a modest retainer can cover multiple analysts and reporting without recruiting costs or ramp-up time.

## 23. Deep Dive: Intelligence Requirements and Stakeholder Mapping

### 23.1 Building a requirements framework

High-quality CTI starts with clear intelligence requirements. A practical approach is to map stakeholders to decisions and align intelligence outputs to those decisions.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. Identify primary stakeholders (CISO, SOC, IR, risk, fraud, legal).
2. Document the decisions each stakeholder makes.
3. Translate decisions into Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs).
4. Convert KIQs into Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs).
5. Define deliverables and cadence for each PIR.

### 23.2 Example PIRs

- Which ransomware groups are targeting our sector and region?
- Are any of our third-party vendors experiencing compromise?
- What vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited against our stack?
- Are our executives being targeted for credential theft or impersonation?

### 23.3 Stakeholder mapping table

| Stakeholder | Decision | Intelligence Needed | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CISO | Budget prioritization | Threat landscape trends | Quarterly |
| SOC Lead | Detection tuning | Campaigns, IOCs, TTPs | Weekly |
| Risk Officer | Supplier risk posture | Third-party threat intel | Monthly |
| Legal/Comms | Breach response | Attribution context | As needed |

### 23.4 Governance considerations

CTI consulting engagements often include a PIR workshop and governance model to ensure intelligence stays aligned with evolving risk priorities.

## 41. Deep Dive: Methodologies, QA, and Evidence Handling

### 41.1 Methodology principles

High-quality CTI consulting relies on repeatable methods that ensure consistency and transparency. Providers should document how they collect, analyze, and validate information, including the analytic standards they follow.

Common methodology elements include:

- **Collection framework**: mapping sources to PIRs and prioritizing based on value.
- **Analytic standards**: consistent use of confidence levels and structured reasoning.
- **Evidence traceability**: the ability to trace conclusions back to source material.
- **Peer review**: analyst work reviewed by peers or senior analysts.

### 41.2 Quality assurance workflows

Effective QA goes beyond grammar checks. It includes factual validation, de-duplication of sources, and ensuring that intelligence is actionable.

Typical QA steps:

1. Analyst drafts report with annotated sources.
2. Senior analyst reviews for analytic rigor and bias.
3. Fact-checking against independent sources.
4. Final review for clarity, relevance, and stakeholder impact.

### 41.3 Evidence handling and source protection

CTI often involves sensitive sources or data. Providers should maintain a clear chain of custody for evidence, ensuring that data is stored securely and that sharing rules are respected. This is particularly important when working with shared intelligence communities, law enforcement, or client data.

### 41.4 Managing misinformation and deception

Threat actors increasingly publish misleading information. Consultants should treat unverified claims with skepticism, corroborate with additional sources, and explicitly mark uncertain findings. This reduces the risk of false alarms and protects credibility with stakeholders.

### 41.5 Editorial standards and readability

Reports should be structured for rapid consumption. Executive summaries, key takeaways, and clear recommendations are essential to ensure intelligence drives action rather than being archived.

## 47. Deep Dive: Contract and SLA Reference Guide

### 47.1 Why SLA clarity matters

CTI consulting outcomes are highly dependent on response times, analyst availability, and deliverable expectations. Clear service-level agreements reduce misunderstandings and provide measurable accountability.

### 47.2 Common SLA elements

- **Response time for ad hoc requests**: time from submission to initial response.
- **Incident surge support**: guaranteed response windows for high-severity events.
- **Report delivery cadence**: dates for weekly and monthly reporting.
- **Escalation paths**: defined points of contact when SLAs are at risk.

### 47.3 Example SLA table

| Request Type | Severity | Target Response | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ad hoc intelligence query | Medium | 48 hours | Standard business hours |
| Executive brief | High | 72 hours | Requires review cycle |
| Incident surge support | Critical | 4 hours | Premium rates apply |
| IOC validation | High | 24 hours | Prioritized if active threat |

### 47.4 Service credit concepts

Some contracts include service credits if SLAs are missed. Credits are usually a small percentage of monthly fees but can be meaningful for encouraging performance. Buyers should ensure credits are balanced and do not create perverse incentives that reduce analyst quality.

### 47.5 Change management and scope control

CTI requirements evolve. Contracts should include change request workflows so that new PIRs or deliverables can be added without disrupting baseline commitments. A typical approach is to allow a limited number of scope adjustments per quarter.

### 47.6 Confidentiality and data ownership

Ensure contracts clarify data ownership for custom deliverables. Many buyers prefer ownership of final reports, while providers retain ownership of methodologies and tooling. Confidentiality clauses should explicitly cover incident details and internal telemetry shared during engagements.

### 47.7 Termination and transition support

If a contract ends, clients should have a plan for knowledge transfer. Transition support clauses can include final documentation, handover briefings, and the return or deletion of collected data.

### 47.8 SLA reporting and auditability

SLA performance should be measured and shared in a simple monthly scorecard. Recommended metrics include average response time for ad hoc requests, percentage of deliverables delivered on schedule, and the number of escalations required. Providers should log request timestamps and maintain an audit trail that can be reviewed during quarterly business reviews. This improves transparency, enables early issue detection, and supports continuous improvement without waiting for contract renewal cycles.

### 47.9 Deliverable acceptance criteria

To avoid disputes, contracts should define what constitutes an acceptable deliverable. Criteria often include alignment to PIRs, inclusion of actionable recommendations, and adherence to agreed formatting or length. Clients may also request a review window (for example, five business days) to request clarifications or corrections. Clear acceptance language reduces rework and preserves trust between analysts and stakeholders.

Acceptance checklists can be lightweight and standardized, covering report structure, key findings, and whether recommendations map to the agreed PIRs. This keeps review cycles efficient while ensuring quality.
It also helps manage expectations.

## Closing Notes

Threat intelligence consulting is a high-value, expertise-driven service that delivers the most impact when aligned with business outcomes and operational workflows. Buyers should focus on relevance, analyst quality, and integration capability rather than volume of raw data. Providers should clearly articulate how their analysis changes defensive posture and accelerates decision-making. Use the rate and package benchmarks in this brief as a starting point for planning, and validate pricing with market quotes tailored to your geography and threat profile.
