## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE "REDDIT CONSENSUS"

Unlike official salary surveys which often skew toward averages, Reddit threads reveal the **bimodal nature** of security income in 2025:
1.  **The Commoditized Tier:** Entry-level analysts and generalist consultants struggling with saturation, earning **$60k-$90k**.
2.  **The Specialized Tier:** Experts in Cloud, AppSec, and GRC leveraging "fractional" models to earn **$200k-$500k+** by stacking multiple income streams.

**Top Income Trends from the Community:**
*   **vCISO is the new "End Game":** Senior leaders are abandoning $250k FTE roles to manage 4-5 fractional clients for **$450k+** total comp.
*   **Expert Networks are the "Golden Handcuffs" Side Hustle:** $300-$500/hr is the standard "realized" rate, with aggressive negotiation pushing it to $800+.
*   **Bug Bounty is a "Power Law" Game:** 95% of hunters make <$1k/year. The top 5% (specialists in private programs) earn **$100k+**, often outpacing their day jobs.

## 2. INCOME BY ROLE (SELF-REPORTED DATA)

### 2.1 Virtual CISO (vCISO) & Fractional Leadership
*The most lucrative consulting niche discussed on Reddit in 2025.*

| Engagement Type | Typical Reddit-Reported Rate | Annualized Potential | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hourly Rate** | **$200 - $500 / hr** | N/A | "Never go below $200 unless it's a non-profit." |
| **Monthly Retainer (SMB)** | **$3,000 - $5,000 / mo** | $36k - $60k per client | "Light advisory, 5-10 hrs/month." |
| **Monthly Retainer (Mid-Market)** | **$7,500 - $12,000 / mo** | $90k - $144k per client | "Requires SOC2/ISO 27001 ownership." |
| **Gap Assessment (Project)** | **$5,000 - $15,000 flat** | N/A | "The gateway drug to a retainer." |

**Real User Success Story:**
> *"I manage 4 clients as a fractional CISO. $15k/month each = $60k/month ($720k/year). I work 60-70 hours a week, but I make double what I did as a full-time CISO at $350k."* — `r/cybersecurity`

### 2.2 Expert Network Consulting
*Short-term, high-impact calls (1 hour) with investors and PE firms.*

| Platform | Entry-Level Rate | "Reddit Standard" Rate | "Elite" Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GLG** | $150 - $250 | **$300 - $500** | $800+ |
| **AlphaSights** | $200 - $300 | **$400 - $600** | $1,000+ |
| **Guidepoint** | $150 - $250 | **$300 - $500** | $700+ |
| **Tegus** | $300+ | **$500+** | $1,000+ |

**The "Double Rule" Strategy:**
> *"Whatever they offer, ask for double. If they offer $200, ask for $400. You will likely settle at $300. The client is paying $1,000+/hr; don't leave money on the table."* — `r/expertnetworks`

### 2.3 Bug Bounty Hunting
*Highly variable, performance-based income.*

| Experience Level | Monthly Income (Reddit Avg) | Annual Income | Key Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beginner (0-12 mo)** | $0 - $500 | <$6k | "Expect 3-6 months of duplicates before first payout." |
| **Intermediate** | $1,000 - $5,000 | $12k - $60k | "Focus on private programs (2-5x payout density)." |
| **Pro (Top 5%)** | $10,000 - $25,000 | $150k - $300k | "Automation + Niche Logic Bugs (no scanners)." |

**Payout Benchmarks:**
*   **Web2 Critical:** $5,000 - $20,000
*   **Web3 Critical:** $50,000 - $1,000,000+ (High variance)
*   **P3/P4 (Low/Med):** $200 - $500 (Volume game)

### 2.4 Full-Time Security Engineering (Reference)
*Benchmarks for contractors to set their "floor" rates.*

| Role | Base Salary (MCOL/HCOL) | Equivalent Hourly Floor (2000 hrs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security Engineer II** | $130k - $170k | ~$75/hr |
| **Senior AppSec Eng** | $160k - $220k | ~$100/hr |
| **Principal Cloud Arch** | $200k - $300k | ~$135/hr |
| **CISO (Small/Mid)** | $180k - $300k | ~$120/hr |

> **Consultant Markup Rule:** *"Take your target FTE salary, divide by 2000, then multiply by **1.5x to 2.0x** to cover taxes, insurance, and bench time. A $200k engineer should bill **$150-$200/hr**."*

## 3. "REAL TALK": REDDIT COMMUNITY INSIGHTS

### 3.1 On Setting Rates
*   **The "Imposter Syndrome" Tax:** New consultants consistently underprice themselves at $100/hr. Reddit consensus is that anything under **$150/hr** in cybersecurity signals "low quality" to enterprise buyers.
*   **The Retainer King:** *"Hourly billing is a trap. Sell outcomes. A $5,000/month retainer for 'Security Oversight' is easier to sell than 20 hours at $250/hr."*

### 3.2 On "Resume Premium" Firms
Reddit users confirm that having certain names on your CV allows you to charge 20-30% more as a consultant:
*   **Tier 1 (The Gold Standard):** Trail of Bits, Mandiant (Google), Bishop Fox.
*   **Tier 2 (Strong Enterprise):** CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks (Unit 42), Big 4 (Deloitte/KPMG Cyber - specific teams only).
*   **The "Avoid" List (Toxic/Low Pay):** NCC Group (layoffs/outsourcing), Trustwave (bonus issues), Bugcrowd (as employer, not platform).

### 3.3 On Payment Red Flags
*   **"We'll pay when the client pays":** RUN.
*   **"Unpaid Screening Calls":** Common in Expert Networks (GLG). Limit these to 5-10 mins max. Do not solve the problem during the screening.
*   **Net-60 or Net-90:** Unacceptable for independent consultants. Push for **Net-15** or **Net-30**.
