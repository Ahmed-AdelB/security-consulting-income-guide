# Offensive Security (OSCP) Instructor Income & Training Business Research

> **Scope note (important):** This report is drafted without live internet access in the current environment. It provides a structured research dossier, data collection plan, and business analysis framework tailored to OffSec-certified instruction and penetration testing training businesses. Any placeholders labeled **VERIFY** require confirmation from primary sources (Offensive Security, official training partners, job postings, instructor agreements, or direct interviews). If you enable network access or provide sources, I can replace placeholders with verified numbers.

## 1) Executive Summary

This document outlines how OffSec-certified instructor income is typically structured, where to find credible rate data, and how to build a profitable penetration testing training business around OSCP/OffSec-aligned curricula. It breaks down instructor engagement models (full-time, contract, partner-delivered), revenue mechanics (day rates, per-seat splits, bonuses), and business models (bootcamps, corporate training, membership cohorts, hybrid mentorship). It also provides a rigorous data-collection framework so you can verify real rates and build a defensible 12‑month financial plan.

**Key takeaways:**

- OffSec instructor compensation varies by engagement type (employee vs. contractor vs. partner-delivered), delivery format (live, virtual, on-demand), and class size/seat pricing.
- In the absence of official published rates, the most reliable evidence comes from authorized training partners, public job postings, instructor contracts, and first‑party instructor interviews.
- A training business should be designed around unit economics (revenue per cohort vs. cost per cohort) and a sales pipeline that converts certification intent into training seats.
- A credible plan needs verified inputs: OffSec partner program terms, instructor rate benchmarks, regional demand signals, and competitive pricing data.

## 2) Research Questions (Primary)

1. **What are OffSec instructor rate structures?** (salary, day rate, per‑class rate, revenue share, bonuses)
2. **What are typical ranges for OffSec‑certified instructors by region and experience?**
3. **What is the cost/revenue structure of OSCP‑aligned training businesses?**
4. **Which training formats maximize margin while preserving completion and exam‑pass rates?**
5. **What are common partner program constraints for delivering OffSec‑aligned training?**

## 3) OffSec Training Ecosystem Overview

**Core assets:**

## 6) Penetration Testing Training Business Model

This section outlines how to build and price an OSCP‑aligned training business without relying on unverified numbers.

### 6.1 Core Offerings

- **Live bootcamp** (5‑10 days) with pre‑work and post‑class lab mentorship.
- **Cohort‑based course** (6‑12 weeks) with weekly live sessions.
- **Mentorship‑only** (students self‑study using OffSec materials; you provide accountability and Q&A).
- **Corporate training** (on‑site or private virtual cohort).

### 6.2 Unit Economics Template

Use this template to calculate profitability once you verify real rates.

**Inputs:**

- `seat_price`
- `class_size`
- `cohort_revenue = seat_price * class_size`
- `instructor_cost = day_rate * days + prep_hours * prep_rate`
- `platform_costs` (LMS, labs, licensing, exam vouchers)
- `support_costs` (TAs, mentors)
- `marketing_cost_per_cohort`
- `admin_overhead`

**Outputs:**

- `gross_margin = cohort_revenue - (instructor_cost + platform_costs + support_costs)`
- `net_margin = gross_margin - (marketing_cost_per_cohort + admin_overhead)`
- `margin_per_student = net_margin / class_size`

### 6.3 Pricing Strategy

- **Value‑based pricing:** price around measurable outcomes (job outcomes, exam pass rate, structured mentorship).
- **Tiered pricing:** Base (no mentoring), Plus (weekly office hours), Premium (1:1 or project review).
- **Corporate pricing:** per‑cohort flat fee + travel + custom lab time.

### 6.4 Sales & Marketing Funnel

**Top‑of‑funnel:**

- OSCP study guides, practice labs, webinars.
- Free workshop or assessment to segment skill levels.

**Mid‑funnel:**

- Email sequences around OSCP readiness.
- Social proof (pass rate, testimonials).

**Bottom‑funnel:**

- Limited seats per cohort.
- Employer sponsorship packages.
