## Executive Summary

The freelance cybersecurity consulting market remains strong due to persistent talent shortages, regulatory pressure, and enterprise security risk exposure. The three dominant marketplaces in this report sit at distinct tiers:

- **Toptal** operates a premium, highly vetted model with top-end rates ($60-$250+/hour, commonly $120-$200 for senior consultants) and 0% freelancer commission. Entry is extremely competitive (<3% acceptance).
- **Upwork** is the volume leader, offering the widest demand surface with median cybersecurity rates around $60/hour, typical ranges $40-$90/hour, and a 10% freelancer fee. Success hinges on positioning and proof of delivery.
- **Fiverr** is a productized gig marketplace where basic security tasks cluster around $22-$30, while Pro listings command premium pricing. Fiverr’s 20% freelancer fee is the highest among the three and must be baked into pricing.

**Key takeaways from internal research:**

- **Net rate discipline** is critical. A $100/hour target net rate requires ~$111/hour on Upwork and ~$125/hour on Fiverr.
- **Success patterns repeat:** Toptal rewards seniority and enterprise-ready deliverables; Upwork rewards rapid responsiveness and proposal clarity; Fiverr rewards productized offers and SEO-driven discoverability.
- **Retainers outperform single projects** for stability. vCISO services ($1,600-$20,000/month) and compliance packages ($5,000-$50,000+) are consistently the most profitable offers.
- **Differentiation drives price power.** Specialists in cloud security, compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001), and vCISO roles consistently earn above platform medians.

## Platform Fee Impact & Net Rate Calculator

Platform fees materially shift take-home pay. Use the net rate formula to protect margin.

**Net rate formula:** `Target Net = Gross Rate x (1 - Platform Fee)`

**Reverse formula:** `Required Gross = Target Net / (1 - Platform Fee)`

### Net Rate Examples

| Target Net | Toptal (0%) | Upwork (10%) | Fiverr (20%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $80/hr | $80/hr | $89/hr | $100/hr |
| $100/hr | $100/hr | $111/hr | $125/hr |
| $150/hr | $150/hr | $167/hr | $188/hr |

**Rule of thumb:**

- Upwork: add ~11% to your desired net rate.
- Fiverr: add ~25% to your desired net rate.
- Toptal: set the rate you want to take home.
