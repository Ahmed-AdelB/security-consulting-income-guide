## 1. Executive Summary

- Cybersecurity due diligence is typically compressed into **2–6 weeks**, making scope clarity and access the main success drivers.
- M&A diligence pricing is driven by **deal size**, **regulatory exposure**, **testing depth**, and **speed-to-close**, not by a single rate.
- Indicative diligence rates span **$150–$350/hr (independent)** up to **$350–$900+/hr (global firms)** with blended-team discounts.
- Typical diligence budgets range from **$25k–$150k** for standard deals to **$600k–$1.5M+** for global, regulated targets.
- VC-backed startups prefer **fractional security leadership** with **$150–$500/hr** or **$2k–$25k/month** retainers.
- Advisory equity is commonly staged: **0.25%–0.75%** (Seed), **0.10%–0.30%** (Series A), **0.05%–0.20%** (Series B+).
- Board and advisory panels pay **$5k–$60k/year** retainers, **$1k–$5k** meeting fees, and **$200–$900/hr** for senior advisors.
- Expert networks used in VC/PE diligence typically deliver **$250–$500/hr** calls, with elite niches reaching **$1,000+/hr**.
- Growth drivers include **regulatory scrutiny**, **insurance underwriting**, **cloud/SaaS sprawl**, and **investor expectations**.
- Market opportunities cluster around **pre-LOI screening**, **confirmatory diligence**, **portfolio security uplift**, and **board oversight**.
- Advisory firms win by productizing **Tier 0–2 diligence**, **SOC 2 readiness**, and **security roadmaps** for portfolio companies.
- Referral-driven channels dominate: **60% conversion** via direct referrals and **40%** via partner handoffs.
- Cold outbound is low yield (<2% conversion) for high-value advisory engagements.

## 3. VC/PE Market Context & Demand Drivers

### 3.1 Why VC/PE Cyber Advisory Demand Is Rising

- **Regulatory exposure** increases scrutiny for fintech, healthcare, and critical infrastructure targets.
- **Cyber insurance pressure** forces diligence evidence and risk memo requirements.
- **Cloud and SaaS sprawl** expands attack surface and third-party dependency risk.
- **Incident visibility** directly influences valuation, escrow, and indemnity negotiations.
- **Investor expectations** demand quantified cyber risk input in investment committee memos.

### 3.2 Startup-Specific Security Drivers

- **Enterprise sales pressure** forces SOC 2 / ISO 27001 readiness earlier (Seed–Series A).
- **Board/investor scrutiny** ties security posture to fundraising and valuation.
- **Regulatory expansion** (privacy laws, SEC disclosure) increases early-stage obligations.
- **CISO burnout and short tenure** increases reliance on fractional leadership.
- **Cost sensitivity** limits full-time CISO hiring (favoring advisory retainers).

### 3.3 Portfolio-Level Drivers (VC/PE)

- **Concentration risk**: a single breach can impact fund performance and exit timing.
- **Operational leverage**: repeatable security playbooks reduce portfolio risk at scale.
- **Exit readiness**: buyers expect documented security programs and incident history.
- **Customer diligence**: security questionnaires appear earlier in revenue cycles.
- **Board duty of care**: cyber oversight is now a governance expectation.

### 3.4 Diligence Timing Realities

- **Pre-LOI screening** is brief and externally focused.
- **Confirmatory diligence** compresses 2–6 weeks into parallel evidence review and testing.
- **Post-close integration** is where remediation budgets and 100-day plans are executed.
