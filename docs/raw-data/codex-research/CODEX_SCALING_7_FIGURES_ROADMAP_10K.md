# Scaling to 7 Figures Roadmap

From **$0/month solo** to **$1M+/month with a team**. This roadmap is structured by revenue bands with clear priorities for hiring, delegation, productized services, and white-label partnerships.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Nail demand before scaling supply.** Validate a repeatable offer and proven acquisition channel first.
2. **Productize to create margin.** Standardize outcomes, timelines, and pricing to scale delivery.
3. **Systematize before hiring.** Build SOPs so the team scales quality, not chaos.
4. **Partnerships amplify distribution.** White-label partners can 10x sales leverage.
5. **Measure everything weekly.** CAC, LTV, gross margin, pipeline value, and cash conversion.

---

## Phase 1: $0 → $10K/month (Solo Validation)

**Objective:** Validate a tight offer with consistent inbound or outbound conversion.

**Core Moves**
- Define one niche and one clear outcome (e.g., “Book 20 qualified B2B calls/month”).
- Create a flagship productized service with fixed scope + timeline.
- Build proof fast: 2–3 case studies, even if discounted or free.
- Choose one acquisition channel (cold email, LinkedIn, content) and go deep.

**Hiring & Delegation**
- None. Use contractors only for design, editing, or one-off tasks.

**Productized Service**
- Fixed deliverables and timeline (2–4 weeks), priced for value.

**KPIs**
- 10–20% close rate on qualified calls.
- $2–5K average order value (AOV).

---

## Phase 2: $10K → $50K/month (Stabilize & Systematize)

**Objective:** Build predictable pipeline and delivery. Remove founder bottlenecks.

**Core Moves**
- Codify delivery into SOPs, checklists, and templates.
- Separate sales from delivery: use a simple CRM and stage-based pipeline.
- Introduce a retainer or maintenance tier for recurring revenue.

**Hiring & Delegation**
- Part-time VA for inbox, scheduling, CRM updates, reporting.
- Specialized freelancer for delivery execution (e.g., ads, design, copy).

**Productized Service**
- Add a “lite” and “premium” tier to widen conversion.

**KPIs**
- 40–60% gross margin.
- 3x pipeline coverage (pipeline value ≥ 3x monthly target).

---

## Phase 3: $50K → $150K/month (Build the Core Team)

**Objective:** Scale delivery capacity while protecting quality.

**Core Moves**
- Create role-based SOPs for delivery, QA, and client success.
- Implement weekly performance reporting and client health scoring.
- Start documenting “playbooks” (sales, delivery, onboarding).

**Hiring & Delegation**
- 1–2 full-time delivery specialists.
- Part-time client success manager (CSM) or account manager.
- Fractional ops or finance support (billing, payroll, forecasting).

**Productized Service**
- Formal onboarding, standardized kickoff, and post-project upsell.

**KPIs**
- 80%+ on-time delivery.
- 20–30% expansion from existing clients.

---

## Phase 4: $150K → $500K/month (Team Scaling & Offer Expansion)

**Objective:** Build repeatable growth engine; expand service lines.

**Core Moves**
- Add a sales system: SDR + closer or founder-led with SDR support.
- Build content/paid acquisition engine; test 2nd channel.
- Introduce a higher-ticket outcome tier or verticalized package.

**Hiring & Delegation**
- Sales development rep (SDR) + closer/AE.
- Full-time client success.
- Delivery lead or team manager.

**Productized Service**
- Vertical-specific packages (e.g., SaaS, local services, e-commerce).

**White-Label Partnerships**
- Identify agencies with strong sales but weak fulfillment.
- Offer a white-label delivery tier with strict SLAs and margin targets.

**KPIs**
- 50%+ gross margin.
- 15–25% net profit.

---

## Phase 5: $500K → $1M+/month (Scale Distribution & Partnerships)

**Objective:** Diversify revenue and scale partnerships without founder dependency.

**Core Moves**
- Build an executive layer: head of delivery, head of growth, head of CS.
- Create quarterly OKRs and monthly planning cadence.
- Double down on partnerships and enterprise deals.

**Hiring & Delegation**
- Senior ops manager.
- Partnership manager.
- Controller or fractional CFO.

**Productized Service**
- Add performance-based pricing or outcome guarantees (if unit economics allow).

**White-Label Partnerships**
- 3–5 anchor partners responsible for 40–60% of revenue.
- Dedicated partner onboarding, reporting, and escalation SOPs.

**KPIs**
- <30% founder involvement in delivery.
- 90%+ retention across top 20 clients.
