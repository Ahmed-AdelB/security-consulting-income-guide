**Subject:** SOC 2 Type II Pentest Requirement

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] recently [trigger event: e.g., raised Series A / posted a Compliance Manager role]. Congratulations!

## 3. Rate Negotiation & Contracting

### 3.1 Turning Down a Lowball Rate
**Subject:** Re: Proposal for [Project]

Hi [Client Name],

Thanks for the transparency on the budget.

Unfortunately, at $[Rate]/hour, we are too far apart for me to deliver the level of rigor and senior oversight this specific project requires. My typical engagements start at the ranges outlined in the proposal to ensure we don't miss critical risks.

I might be able to refer you to a more junior consultant who fits that budget range if you'd like? Otherwise, if the budget opens up in the future for a deeper dive, let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

### 3.2 The Annual Rate Increase
**Subject:** 2026 Rate Schedule & Partnership Update

Hi [Client Name],

I'm writing to share a quick update on our partnership for the coming year. First, I've really enjoyed working on [Project/Success] this year.

As my practice has grown and I've invested in new [Certifications/Tooling/Capabilities], I am updating my standard rate schedule for 2026.

Effective [Date - 30-60 days out], my hourly rate will move to **$[New Rate]/hour** (from $[Old Rate]).

**However**, for long-term partners like you, I want to keep your current rate locked in for an additional **3 months** as a thank you. Alternatively, if you'd like to lock in the current rate for the full year, we can switch to a pre-paid retainer model.

Let me know if you'd like to explore that.

Best,
[Your Name]

### 3.3 Confirming Cancellation Terms (Tegus/Networks)

Thanks,
[Your Name]

**Subject:** Transcript Usage Confirmation

Hi [Associate Name],
