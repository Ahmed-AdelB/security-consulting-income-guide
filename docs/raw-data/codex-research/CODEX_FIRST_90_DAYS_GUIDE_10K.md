## 5. Critical Rules for the First 90 Days

1.  **Speed Kills:** The median time to fill an Expert Network slot is <4 hours. If you reply in 20 minutes, you win. If you reply in 4 hours, you lose.
2.  **Keywords Matter:** Recruiters search by keywords. Don't say "Firewall Administration". Say "Palo Alto Networks Migration & Configuration". Specificity wins.
3.  **Fake It 'Til You Make It (Confidence):** When asked "Can you talk about X?", say "Yes, I have deployed that in 3 environments." Don't be humble. You are the expert.
4.  **No Free Coffees:** Do not "pick your brain" for free. If someone wants to talk shop, send them your Calendly link with a stripe payment attached, or your GLG referral link.
5.  **The "No" is a "Not Yet":** If a vCISO prospect says no to a $5k retainer, offer a $1k audit. Get your foot in the door.
