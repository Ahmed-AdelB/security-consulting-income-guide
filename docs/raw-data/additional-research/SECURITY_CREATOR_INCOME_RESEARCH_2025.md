# SECURITY CREATOR INCOME RESEARCH 2025: Patreon vs. Ko-fi & The "Academy" Shift

**Date:** December 24, 2025  
**Scope:** Deep dive into cybersecurity content creator monetization, membership income, and platform strategies.  
**Focus:** Patreon, Ko-fi, and Proprietary Platforms.

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Academy" Pivot

The landscape of cybersecurity creator income has shifted significantly. While Patreon and Ko-fi remain vital starting points, the top earners in the industry (e.g., NetworkChuck, The Cyber Mentor) have moved beyond simple "supporter" models to full-fledged **Educational Academies**.

*   **The Trend:** Moving from "Donations" ($5/mo) to "Tuition" ($30+/mo).
*   **Key Insight:** High-value creators are building their own platforms to avoid Patreon's 8-12% fees and own the customer relationship (CRM) entirely.
*   **Income Reality:** Public Patreon numbers are often hidden, but revenue estimates based on audience size suggest top creators generate 6-figure monthly recurring revenue (MRR) through diversified streams (Ads, Sponsors, Affiliates, Memberships).

## 2. Platform Showdown: Patreon vs. Ko-fi for Security

For a security consultant or creator starting today, the choice depends on the "Frequency of Output" and "Depth of Content".

| Feature | **Patreon** | **Ko-fi** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Model** | **Subscription (Recurring)** | **Donation (One-off) + Shop** |
| **Best For** | Deep-dive tutorials, CTF walkthroughs, Private Discords, Consistent monthly content. | Releasing tools, scripts, cheat sheets, "Buy me a coffee" tips, irregular upload schedules. |
| **Fee Structure** | **8% - 12%** of income + processing fees. | **0%** on donations (Free plan), 5% on shop/subs (or $6/mo Gold for 0%). |
| **Payouts** | Monthly (typically). | **Instant** (Direct to PayPal/Stripe). |
| **Security Vibe** | "Exclusive Club" / "Inner Circle" | "Open Source Support" / "Tip Jar" |
| **Key Weakness** | High pressure to produce monthly content to prevent churn. | Harder to predict monthly income; lower conversion to recurring. |

### Verdict for Security Consultants:
*   **Use Ko-fi if:** You release open-source tools on GitHub and want a "Sponsor" button, or if you sell one-off PDF guides/cheat sheets.
*   **Use Patreon if:** You can promise a monthly "Private Intelligence Briefing," "Malware Analysis Video," or access to a "Mentorship Discord."

## 3. Case Studies & Income Models

Since exact private tax data is unavailable, we use industry standard conversion rates (0.1% - 1% of YouTube subscribers converting to paid members) and public pricing data to model income.

### A. NetworkChuck (The "Academy" Model)
*   **Strategy:** Started with Patreon, evolved into **NetworkChuck Academy**.
*   **Pricing:** ~$30/month (Premium Membership).
*   **Content:** Full CCNA/Python courses, browser-based labs.
*   **Estimated Scale:** With 4M+ subscribers, even a conservative 0.1% conversion rate (4,000 members) at $30/mo = **$120,000/month** (Estimate).
*   **Takeaway:** The real money is in selling *skills*, not just content.

### B. John Hammond (The "Community" Model)
*   **Strategy:** Maintains a Patreon for "Inner Circle" support while keeping most content free/sponsored.
*   **Pricing:** Tiers likely range from $2 - $20 (Standard Patreon model).
*   **Value Prop:** Supporting the "Free Education" mission, occasional behind-the-scenes.
*   **Takeaway:** High volume of low-tier supporters can equal significant income without locking education behind a paywall.

### C. The Cyber Mentor (The "Certification" Model)
*   **Strategy:** Heath Adams (TCM Security) pivoted from Patreon to **PNPT Certification** and his own academy.
*   **Pricing:** One-time course fees ($30-$300) + Certification Exam fees ($400+).
*   **Takeaway:** Creating an industry-recognized standard (certification) is the ultimate monetization tier.

## 4. Income Potential Modeling (The "5K Research" Estimate)

If you are a mid-sized security creator/consultant, here is what you can realistically expect to earn based on audience size.

**Assumptions:**
*   **Conversion Rate:** 0.5% (Conservative active fan base).
*   **Avg. Member Value:** $10/month (Blended tier of $5 basic + $25 pro).

| Audience Size (YouTube/LinkedIn) | Active Members (0.5%) | Est. Monthly Income | Est. Yearly Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1,000** (Micro-Influencer) | 5 | $50 | $600 |
| **10,000** (Established Pro) | 50 | $500 | $6,000 |
| **50,000** (Industry Voice) | 250 | $2,500 | $30,000 |
| **100,000** (Star) | 500 | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| **1,000,000** (Legend) | 5,000 | $50,000 | $600,000 |

*Note: This excludes ad revenue, sponsorships ($2k-$10k per integrated spot), and affiliate income (VPNs, Password Managers), which often 2x-5x the membership income.*

## 5. Strategic Recommendations for 2025

1.  **Don't Rely on Patreon Alone:** Use it as a CRM, but build your email list. Patreon owns the audience; you rent it.
2.  **The "Ko-fi Shop" is Underrated:** Selling a $20 "Pentest Reporting Template" or "GRC Checklist" on Ko-fi often outperforms a $5/mo Patreon tier for smaller creators because it's a tangible asset.
3.  **High-Ticket Tiers:** Offer a $100+/mo tier for "Monthly 1-on-1 Career Coaching" (Limited to 5 people). This instantly adds $500/mo to your bottom line with minimal content production overhead.
4.  **Corporate Sponsorships > Individual Subs:** In security, one vendor sponsorship (e.g., from a SIEM or EDR company) can be worth 500 individual $5 patrons.

## 6. Top "Creator Economy" Niches in Security
*   **Bug Bounty:** Selling methodology guides, private recon lists.
*   **GRC (Governance):** Selling policy templates, audit checklists (High value B2B).
*   **Cert Prep:** Custom flashcards, practice labs for CISSP/OSCP.
*   **Career:** Resume reviews, mock interviews (High demand).
