**For $100K Full-Time Role:**

- **Equivalent Contractor Annual:** $150K - $200K
- **Hourly Rate:** $72 - $96/hour
- **Why:** Contractor pays own:
  - Health insurance ($6K - $20K/year)
  - Retirement savings (no match)
  - Self-employment tax (15.3%)
  - No PTO (unpaid vacation)
  - Own equipment and workspace

#### Employer Cost Comparison (24-month engagement)

**Full-Time Employee ($100K base):**

- Base Salary: $200,000
- Benefits: $50,000
- Training: $2,400
- Technology: $5,000
- Overhead: $15,000

**Contractor ($75/hour, 40 hrs/week):**

#### When to Use Each Model

**Full-Time Employees:**

- Long-term strategic roles (2+ years)
- Company-specific knowledge critical
- Team continuity important
- Benefits package is competitive advantage
- Equity/retention important

**Contractors:**

- Project-based work (3-12 months)
- Specialized expertise needed temporarily

- Skills gaps while hiring FTE
- Consulting/advisory work

### Remote Work Impact on Salaries
