# SECURITY TRAINING & SPEAKING INCOME GUIDE 2025

## Scope & Data Sources

**Data Snapshot:** December 7, 2025 platform tracker

**Primary Source:** `ALL_PLATFORMS_LIST.txt` (training and speaking entries)

**Focus Areas:**

- SANS instructor income
- Pluralsight author royalties
- Conference & event speaking compensation

**Note:** Rates are indicative and sourced from internal tracker entries. Confirm with each program before relying on figures.

---

## Executive Summary

- **Training income is episodic.** Compensation depends on delivery count, course length, and prep time, not just daily rate.
- **SANS instruction is prestige-heavy but capacity-limited.** Day-rate compensation is attractive only if you teach multiple deliveries each year.
- **Pluralsight royalties are long-tail.** Income scales with catalog depth, evergreen topics, and consistent watch-time.
- **Conference speaking is mostly marketing.** Paid opportunities exist through speaker bureaus and corporate events, but many conferences are unpaid.

## 1. SANS Instructor Income Guide

### 1.1 Role Definition

SANS instructors deliver multi-day, high-intensity security training. The program values deep technical expertise, curriculum ownership, and consistent teaching quality. SANS is typically associated with GIAC certifications, so instructor credibility must match advanced practitioner standards.

### 1.2 Requirements & Entry Path

- Documented expertise in a specific security domain
- Prior teaching or workshop delivery experience
- Strong industry recognition (publications, talks, tools, or certifications)
- Ability to travel and deliver multi-day courses in person or live online
- Consistent course quality and timely updates to material

### 1.3 Compensation Model (Tracker)

- **Daily rate:** $300-$800/day (internal tracker)
- Compensation is typically tied to delivery days, not prep or updates
- Some programs include travel or per-delivery stipends; confirm contract terms

### 1.4 Realistic Income Scenarios (Based on Tracker Day Rate)

**Assumptions:** 5-day delivery per course, 1-6 deliveries per year

| Annual Deliveries | Low ($300/day) | High ($800/day) | Practical Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | $1,500 | $4,000 | Occasional guest delivery |
| 3 | $4,500 | $12,000 | Side income, limited calendar |
| 6 | $9,000 | $24,000 | Significant side stream |

**Reality Check:** The tracker rates are conservative relative to SANS course pricing. Treat these as minimum baselines and verify the actual contract structure.

### 1.5 Time & Effort Expectations

- 5-7 delivery days per course
- 1-2 additional days for prep, updates, and lab maintenance
- Delivery travel and calendar blocks reduce consulting capacity

## 2. Pluralsight Author Income Guide

### 2.1 Role Definition

Pluralsight authors produce on-demand video courses. Compensation is royalty-based and tied to learner consumption, not a fixed upfront rate. The model favors consistent publishing, evergreen topics, and sustained watch-time.

### 2.2 Requirements & Entry Path

- Proven expertise and a narrow technical focus
- Ability to script, record, and edit professional video lessons
- Strong instructional design (labs, demos, and assessments)
- Willingness to refresh content as tools and threats evolve

### 2.3 Compensation Model (Tracker)

- **Royalty-based:** Earnings tied to platform consumption
- No guaranteed base pay; income fluctuates with subscriber engagement
- Catalog depth and content freshness drive long-term earnings

### 2.4 Realistic Income Expectations

- **New authors:** Expect low and volatile royalties until the catalog grows
- **Consistent authors:** 2-5 courses can support modest supplemental income
- **Top performers:** Larger catalogs and high engagement can generate meaningful annual royalties

**Income Lever Checklist:**

- Choose evergreen, high-demand topics (cloud security, threat detection, GRC)
- Build course sequences (intro → intermediate → advanced)
- Refresh content every 12-18 months
- Promote via conference talks, blogs, and employer newsletters

| Annual Paid Engagements | Indicative Range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 bureau gigs | $1,000-$20,000 | Tracker data is truncated; verify per-gig rates |
| 1 premium keynote | $5,000-$50,00 | Enterprise or bureau-managed events |
