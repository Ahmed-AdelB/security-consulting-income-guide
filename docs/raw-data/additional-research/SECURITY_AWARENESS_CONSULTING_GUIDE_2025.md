# Security Awareness Training & Phishing Simulation Consulting Guide (2025)

## Executive Summary
Security Awareness Training (SAT) and Phishing Simulation have evolved from compliance checkboxes to critical managed services. With the rise of social engineering attacks and strict regulations (NIS2, SEC rules, CMMC), organizations are actively seeking consultants to **manage** these platforms, not just buy them.

**Market Opportunity:**
- **Service Type:** Managed Security Awareness Programs (MSAP)
- **Target Rate:** $125 - $250/hour (Consulting) or $3 - $8 per user/month (Managed Service)
- **Key Platforms:** KnowBe4, Proofpoint, Phished.io, Cofense

## 1. KnowBe4 Consulting Ecosystem

KnowBe4 is the market leader (Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader). While they sell directly to enterprises, a massive ecosystem exists for **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)** and **Consultants** to manage the platform for clients.

### Consultant Roles & Income
*   **Implementation Specialist:** Setting up AD integration, whitelisting, and baseline testing.
    *   *Rate:* $100 - $175/hour
    *   *Project Fee:* $1,500 - $5,000 per implementation (depending on org size).
*   **Program Manager (Retainer):** Monthly management of campaigns, reporting, and "Clicker" remedial training.
    *   *Retainer:* $1,000 - $3,000/month per client (for SMBs).
    *   *Tasks:* Selecting template schedules, analyzing "Phish-prone Percentage," reporting to the Board.

### Platform Pricing (Estimates)
*   **Diamond Tier:** ~$1.70 - $2.00 per user/month.
*   **Consultant Margin:** Partners can resell KnowBe4. Margins typically range from 15% to 25% recurring revenue, *plus* the 100% margin on your management fees.

### Strategy: The "Human Firewall" Package
Don't just sell the license. Sell the **outcome**.
*   **Offer:** "Complete Staff Hardening Program"
*   **Includes:** License + Monthly Phishing Tests + Quarterly Executive Reports + Remedial Training for Repeat Offenders.
*   **Price:** Cost of License + 50-100% Markup (Service Fee).

## 2. Proofpoint Security Awareness Training

Proofpoint targets the enterprise / mid-market. Their SAT solution is often bundled with their email gateway products, making it a "stickier" ecosystem.

### Consultant Rates
*   **Enterprise Consultant:** $150 - $300/hour.
*   **Focus:** Proofpoint requires more complex configuration regarding email routing and "TAP" (Targeted Attack Protection) integration.
*   **Certification:** Proofpoint Certified Security Awareness Specialist (PCSAS) increases billable rates by ~20%.

### Income Reality
*   **Managed Services:** Proofpoint offers their own managed service, but it is expensive. Smaller boutique consultancies can undercut this by offering "White Glove" service for 20-30% less than Proofpoint's direct professional services.
*   **Content Customization:** High value in customizing Proofpoint's "content modules" to match the client's specific industry (e.g., HIPAA specific modules for healthcare clients).

## 3. Phishing Simulation Consulting (The "PhaaS" Model)

Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) is a lucrative recurring revenue model. You act as the "Bad Guy" on a scheduled basis.

### Pricing Models
1.  **Per-User Model (Recurring):**
    *   *Price:* $2 - $5 per user / month.
    *   *Includes:* 1-2 simulations per month, auto-enrollment in training for clickers.
    *   *Margins:* High. (Software costs ~$1/user, you keep the rest).
2.  **Per-Campaign Model (One-off):**
    *   *Price:* $1,500 - $3,500 per campaign.
    *   *Includes:* Design of a specific spear-phishing scenario (e.g., "CEO Fraud" or "HR Benefits Update"), execution, and a detailed "Post-Mortem" report.

### Income Potential Breakdown (Example)
*   **Client:** 500-employee Healthcare firm.
*   **Software Cost:** ~$12k/year (KnowBe4/Proofpoint).
*   **Your Management Fee:** $18k/year ($1,500/mo retainer).
*   **Total Contract:** $30k/year.
*   **Time Commitment:** 2-4 hours/month after initial setup.
*   **Effective Hourly Rate:** $375 - $750/hour.

## 4. Specialized Niches & High-Value Add-ons

To reach the "$5K Research" target (likely referring to high monthly retainers), you must specialize.

### "Vishing" (Voice Phishing) & "Smishing" (SMS)
*   **Premium Service:** Most automated platforms do email well, but voice/SMS poorly.
*   **Rate:** $200 - $300 per hour for live social engineering calls.
*   **Package:** "Executive Protection Package" – testing EA/Admins specifically against voice attacks.

### "Culture Assessments"
*   **Survey-Based Consulting:** Assessing the *attitude* of employees towards security, not just if they click links.
*   **Deliverable:** Culture Maturity Report.
*   **Price:** $5,000 - $10,000 flat fee.

### Metrics & Board Reporting
*   Many CISOs struggle to translate "4% click rate" into business risk.
*   **Service:** "CISO Dashboarding"
*   **Deliverable:** Monthly slide deck translating phishing stats into "Risk Reduction ROI."
*   **Value:** Saves the CISO 4 hours/month. Charge $500-$1,000/month just for this report.

## 5. Comparison: KnowBe4 vs. Proofpoint vs. Open Source

| Feature | KnowBe4 | Proofpoint | GoPhish (Open Source) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Segment** | SMB to Enterprise | Mid-Market to Enterprise | Budget / DIY Consultant |
| **Consultant Opp** | **High** (Resell + Manage) | **Medium** (Integration focus) | **High** (100% Service Revenue) |
| **Cost Basis** | Medium ($$) | High ($$$) | Free ($0) + Hosting |
| **Setup Effort** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Best For** | Volume Consulting | Enterprise Integration | High-Margin / Low-Budget Clients |

*Note: Using GoPhish (or similar open source) allows you to keep 100% of the revenue, but requires you to manage SMTP servers and reputation, which can be a technical headache. For scalable consulting, reselling KnowBe4/Proofpoint is often more profitable due to lower maintenance.*
