## 2. Platform Satisfaction Rankings

Scores are derived from sentiment analysis of discussion threads (0-10 scale).

### 🥇 Overall Satisfaction
1.  **Third Bridge (8.2/10):** consistently praised for organization, payment speed, and professional staff.
2.  **Guidepoint (7.5/10):** High volume, generally reliable, though some friction with payment disputes.
3.  **GLG (7.1/10):** The "necessary evil." Highest volume but lowest "warmth." impersonal, unpaid surveys are a major detractor.
4.  **Dialectica (7.0/10):** Strong in Europe, mixed reviews on payment pro-rating (strict minute-by-minute).
5.  **AlphaSights (6.5/10):** High potential earnings but frequent complaints about "aggressive" associates and last-minute cancellations.

### 💸 Payment Reliability
1.  **Third Bridge:** "Clockwork," "Superior payment system."
2.  **GLG:** Reliable, standard net-15 terms.
3.  **Guidepoint:** Generally fast, occasional disputes on call duration.
4.  **Dialectica:** Varies (20-30 days), some complaints about clawbacks.
5.  **AlphaSights:** Reliable but strict.

## 3. Work Volume Analysis (Reddit Consensus)

*   **High Volume (The "Big Two"):** **GLG** and **Guidepoint**. Users report these two account for ~70% of all inbound requests.
*   **Mid Volume:** **AlphaSights** and **Third Bridge**. Fewer requests, but often higher quality/relevance.
*   **Low Volume:** **Dialectica** (unless Europe-focused) and smaller niche networks.

## 4. Key "Voice of the Expert" Insights (2025)

*   **"The Rate Cap Myth":** Many users in 2025 report breaking through "soft caps." GLG often claims a $500 cap but approves $800+ for the right project.
*   **"Feast or Famine":** The most common sentiment. "I made $5k in March and $0 in April."
*   **"Screening Fatigue":** A major burnout factor. Experts are rejecting platforms that require >10 mins of unpaid screening.
*   **"Commoditization":** Concern about platforms like Tegus (and to a lesser extent Third Bridge) recording calls for a library, effectively "selling your brain once" for infinite resale.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations for Consultants

1.  **Anchor High:** Start negotiations at $500/hr. It is easier to drop to $350 than to raise from $200.
2.  **Diversify:** Active active profiles on all Top 5 platforms is the only way to smooth out income volatility.
3.  **Reject Unpaid Work:** The community consensus is shifting against long unpaid surveys.
4.  **Use Aggregators:** Tools like Inex One are gaining traction to manage multiple logins.
