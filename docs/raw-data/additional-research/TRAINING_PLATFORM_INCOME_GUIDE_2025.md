## Executive Summary: The State of Security Training Income

In 2025, the "passive income" dream of recording a single course and retiring is largely dead for the average instructor. The market has bifurcated into two distinct tiers: **Commoditized Volume** (Udemy, YouTube) and **Premium Specialization** (SANS, OffSec, Specialized Bootcamps).

While entry-level generalist content faces extreme price pressure, demand for highly specialized, advanced security training (Cloud Security, AI Red Teaming, ICS/SCADA) allows top instructors to command significant premiums.

## 1. The "Ivy League": High-Barrier, High-Reward

### SANS Institute
*   **Model:** Elite, invite-only/audition-based. Instructors are typically top-tier industry practitioners.
*   **Income Potential:** **EXTREMELY HIGH**
    *   **Per Event:** Anecdotal reports consistently place pay between **$9,000 - $13,000 per teaching week** (varies by class size and seniority).
    *   **Annualized:** A "Lead" instructor teaching 6-8 times a year can easily net **$60k - $100k+** as a *side income* on top of their day job.
    *   **Full-Time Fellows:** Top-tier SANS Fellows who author courseware can earn significantly more (revenue share models), potentially exceeding **$300k-$500k/year** from training alone.
*   **Barrier to Entry:** Extremely High. Requires "Mentor" program graduation, peer review, and distinct public speaking ability.

### Offensive Security (OffSec)
*   **Model:** Employee-based (mostly). Instructors and content developers are typically full-time employees.
*   **Income Potential:** **HIGH (Salary-based)**
    *   **Roles:** "Offensive Security Engineer", "Content Developer", "Student Mentor".
    *   **Salary Range:** **$130,000 - $170,000** base salary for content creators/engineers.
    *   **Top Tier:** Senior researchers/trainers can command **$200k+** total compensation.
*   **Notes:** Less "passive income" potential, but highly stable with benefits. Excellent for brand building.

## 2. The "Marketplace": Volume & Volatility

### Udemy
*   **Model:** Open marketplace. You keep a % of sales.
*   **2025 Reality:** **DECLINING MARGINS**
    *   **Revenue Share:** Drastic cuts in 2024/2025 for "Udemy Business" (subscription) revenue share (down to ~17.5-20%).
    *   **Income Potential:**
        *   **Bottom 75%:** <$1,000/year (Hobbyist).
        *   **Mid-Tier:** $2,000 - $10,000/year (Successful side hustle).
        *   **Top 1%:** $50,000+ (Full-time income). Requires massive volume (tens of thousands of students) or a specific niche monopoly.
    *   **Strategy:** Success now requires bringing your *own* audience. Relying on organic Udemy traffic is increasingly difficult due to algorithm changes and "Udemy Business" dominance.

### Pluralsight
*   **Model:** Royalty-based (pay-per-view/minute watched). Invitation/Audition required.
*   **Status:** **MATURE / SATURATED**
    *   **Income:** Historically, top authors made **$100k - $500k/year**.
    *   **Current Trend:** "Black box" algorithms determine royalty rates. As the library grows, individual course views dilute.
    *   **Expectation:** Good for consistent "long tail" income ($5k-$20k/year for a solid library of courses), but difficult to break into the "wealthy author" tier starting in 2025 without covering a brand-new, hot technology (e.g., specific AI Security frameworks).

## 3. Independent & Creator Economy

### Self-Hosted (Teachable, Kajabi, Maven)
*   **Model:** You own the platform and the customer email list.
*   **Income Potential:** **UNCAPPED but HARD**
    *   **Metrics:** A cohort-based course (CBC) charged at $500-$1,000/student with 20 students = **$10k-$20k per weekend**.
    *   **Requirement:** Requires a massive personal brand (LinkedIn/Twitter/YouTube following).
    *   **Success Story:** Specialized "Bug Bounty" or "Smart Contract Auditing" bootcamps often outperform general platforms because they sell a specific *outcome* (getting a job/bounty) rather than just *knowledge*.

## 4. Income Tiers Summary (2025 Estimates)

| Tier | Profile | Platform Mix | Estimated Annual Income (Training Only) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hobbyist** | 1-2 Udemy courses, occasional blog | Udemy, Medium | **$0 - $1,500** |
| **Side Hustler** | 3-5 courses, active social media | Udemy, YouTube, Guest Lectures | **$5,000 - $25,000** |
| **Pro Trainer** | SANS Instructor (Part-time) or Top Udemy Niche | SANS, Private Workshops | **$60,000 - $150,000** |
| **Elite** | SANS Fellow, "Guru" Brand, Bootcamp Owner | Proprietary, SANS, Consulting | **$250,000 - $1M+** |

## 5. Strategic Niches for 2025

To maximize income, avoid "Intro to Cyber Security" or "CEH Prep". The money is in the **deltas**—what is new, broken, and un-taught?

1.  **AI Red Teaming (LLM Security):** Massive demand, near-zero supply of quality training.
2.  **Cloud Native Security (Kubernetes/Serverless):** deeply technical, high enterprise value.
3.  **Smart Contract Auditing (Rust/Solidity):** Still highly lucrative despite crypto winter volatility.
4.  **ICS/OT Security:** Niche, expensive, and requires hardware knowledge (high barrier to entry).
