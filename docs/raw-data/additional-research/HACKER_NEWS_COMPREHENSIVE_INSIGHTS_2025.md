- Reduces noise significantly
- Still requires human verification

### Recommendations

**Tool Selection**:

- Don't rely solely on dependency scanners
- Use context-aware tools (Govulncheck-style)
- Combine automated + manual review
- Prioritize by exploitability, not just presence

**Process**:

- Filter vulnerabilities by actual usage
- Verify exploitability in your context
- Prioritize based on risk, not CVSS alone
- Don't auto-update everything - test first

**Career Development**:

- Learn to assess exploitability, not just identify CVEs
- Understand false positive causes
- Develop tooling to reduce noise
- Focus on human factors (Psychology Framework)

### Criticisms

- CVE system broken - too many false alarms
- "Has CVE" doesn't mean exploitable
- Automated tools create overwhelming noise
- Dependabot "lazy" approach not helpful
- Scanners don't understand code context
- Vulnerability quantity meaningless metric
- Industry focused on detection, not actual risk

**[OSCP is no fucking joke. It's hard](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14632372)** (June 2017)

- Challenging examination
- Comprehensive approach

### Income Context

- OSCP can help land pentesting roles
- Government/defense often require certifications
- CISSP/CISSM for management jobs
- Certification alone insufficient - need skills

### Platform Experiences

**OSCP Unique Aspects**:

- Hands-on 24-hour exam
- Must actually hack machines
- Comprehensive lab (not just vulnerable programs)
- "Try harder" philosophy
- Tests real ability, not memorization

**Compared to Other Certs**:

- Security+: Entry-level, limited value
- GIAC: Expensive but respected if employer pays

**Industry Perception**:

- Respected by technical people
- Won't be discriminated against
- Shows dedication and skill
- But certifications generally controversial

### Recommendations

**Worth Getting**:

- OSCP: Yes, if going into offensive security
- Offensive Security certs generally
- GIAC: If employer pays
- CISSP/CISSM: For management track

**Skip**:

- CEH: Go straight to OSCP
- Most vendor certs (unless job requires)
- Anything "mile wide, inch deep"
- Certs as substitute for experience

**Approach**:

- OSCP for pentesting career
- Use as learning opportunity, not just credential
- "Try harder" mindset valuable beyond exam
- Government/defense jobs may require despite criticism

**Career Strategy**:

- Build skills first, cert second
- If employer intensely cares about certs: red flag
- Don't rely on cert alone
- Combine with portfolio and experience

### Criticisms

- "Mean fuck all in industry" (harsh but common view)
- Shouldn't be required by employers
- Can't replace real experience
- Expensive way to learn
- Some employers over-rely on certs
- OSCP: "No fucking joke" - very difficult
- Certification obsession at some companies problematic

## CONCLUSION

The Hacker News community provides extensive, candid insights into security consulting, bug bounties, and expert networks. Key themes:

1. **Income potential is high but uneven**: $300-500/hour possible for specialized consultants, $2M for critical bug bounties, but most struggle to break in and command premium rates.

2. **Platforms have significant issues**: Bug bounty platforms criticized for favoritism, poor triage, and payment disputes. Direct relationships often superior.

3. **Traditional path still best**: Programming/networking → security. Bootcamps flooding market with unprepared candidates.

4. **Specialization essential**: Generalists struggle. Deep expertise in specific domain (cloud, smart contracts, AppSec, etc.) commands premium.

5. **Certifications controversial**: OSCP respected for hands-on nature. Most others dismissed. Employer obsession with certs is red flag.

6. **Industry has ethical concerns**: Security consulting called "scam industry" by insiders. Compliance theater common. Platforms criticized for controlling narrative.

7. **AI changing landscape**: Smart contract audits moving to AI-assisted, red teaming for LLMs emerging, but human expertise still essential.

8. **Open source movement growing**: Kexa.io, ZeusCloud, MISP, etc. Democratizing security tools.

9. **Real-world pragmatism**: Focus on practical wins (MFA, privilege reduction) over perfect security. Mitigations over eliminating all risk.

10. **Network matters most**: Word-of-mouth primary lead source for established consultants. Personal connections essential for freelancers.

This research provides comprehensive insights for anyone considering expert network platforms, bug bounty work, security consulting, or vCISO services based on real experiences from the Hacker News community spanning 15+ years.
