### Key Findings from Quora Discussions

**Setting Your Rate (AlphaSights):**

> "Speaking as someone who has consulted for AlphaSights and has worked in the 'expert network' industry – you get to determine your rate completely on your own. They will accept whatever you say. It is the policy of companies like AlphaSights to accept whatever fee you demand."

**GLG Council Member Experience:**

> "I've generally found them to take a lot more than they give. When I signed up with GLG I expected to receive some meaningful referrals for real consulting projects. My experience has been that most engagements are 1/2 hour."

**Engagement Frequency (GLG Expert):**

> "I've noted a change in the frequency with which I get booked having dropped from $350 an hour to $250 an hour. I previously found myself booked about once a quarter... I'm currently finding myself booked about once a month."

**Zintro Experience:**

> "Never. And not for lack of trying. Plenty of inquiry emails (I get 5-10 every week, many of which sound pretty interesting, and maybe have responded to, I don't know, 30-50 in the past 3 years. Only twice in that time has anyone ever responded to my response, and I've never once..." [landed a contract]

**Platform Optimization:**

> "GLG is optimized around providing value to the consumer of the expert knowledge, not" [the experts themselves]

**Database Criticism:**

> "GLG may be big, but that doesn't make them the best or efficient. Many of these expert networks talk up 'database size' - they have 200, 300, 500k experts in an outdated repository."

## Conclusion

The Quora consulting community provides valuable real-world insights into expert networks, bug bounties, and security consulting opportunities:

**Expert Networks** offer legitimate side income ($500-$2K/month) for professionals with deep expertise, though engagement is sporadic and platforms take significant cuts.

**Bug Bounty** is a challenging path that works better as a learning tool and side income than as primary employment for most people. Only the top 2% earn six figures annually.

**Security Consulting** remains the highest-earning path ($150K-$350K annually), but requires significant experience and credentials before going independent.

**The Hybrid Approach** (full-time employment + expert networks + occasional freelance) appears to be the most sustainable strategy for building consulting income while maintaining financial stability.

**Success factors** across all platforms: deep specialization, continuous learning, realistic expectations, patience, and starting part-time while employed.
