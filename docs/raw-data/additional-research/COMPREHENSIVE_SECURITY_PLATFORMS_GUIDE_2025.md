## PART 3: BUG BOUNTY & PTaaS (TRUSTPILOT vs. G2)

*Comparing Enterprise (G2) vs. Researcher (Trustpilot) Sentiment.*

### 1. HACKERONE
*   **G2 (Enterprise):** 4.5/5 - "Market Leader." Clients love the scale.
*   **Trustpilot (Researcher):** 3.7/5 - "Average."
*   **Analysis:** A divergence exists. Enterprises love the platform's massive pool (1.5M+ hackers). Researchers (Trustpilot/Reddit) express frustration with "Triage" incompetence, slow mediation, and older researchers dominating private invites.
*   **Bottom Line:** Great for buyers, harder for new hunters.

### 2. BUGCROWD
*   **G2 (Enterprise):** 4.9/5 - "Highest Rated."
*   **Trustpilot (Researcher):** 3.9/5 - "Great."
*   **Analysis:** Better alignment. Both buyers and researchers rate Bugcrowd highly. The "100% Willingness to Recommend" on G2 is mirrored by better researcher sentiment regarding fairness and triage speed.

### 3. COBALT.IO (PTaaS)
*   **G2 (Enterprise):** 4.7/5 (88 Badges).
*   **Trustpilot:** N/A
*   **Analysis:** Dominates the "Pentest as a Service" market. The model (paid hourly/per credit rather than bounty) attracts more professional, stable senior testers (average 11 years exp).

### 4. SYNACK
*   **G2 (Enterprise):** 3.9/5.
*   **Trustpilot:** N/A
