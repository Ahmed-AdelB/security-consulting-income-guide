# Real User Experiences with Expert Network Platforms (2024-2025)

This report aggregates authentic user feedback, complaints, and earnings data from consultants across major expert network platforms. Sources include Reddit (r/consulting, r/expertnetworks), Glassdoor, and industry forums.

## 1. Hourly Rates Reality Check

| Platform | Typical Range (USD/hr) | High-End (USD/hr) | Low-End / Starting | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GLG** | $300 - $500 | $800+ | $100 - $200 | Very wide variance. High rates possible for niche experts. |
| **AlphaSights** | $250 - $400 | $1,000+ | $150 | "Dicey" pricing above $500/hr unless very niche. |
| **Tegus** | $400 - $600 | $800+ | $300 | Pays well, especially for Tech/AI topics. Calls are recorded/archived. |
| **Third Bridge** | $300 - $600 | $700+ | $100 | Often starts low; requires negotiation. |
| **Guidepoint** | $200 - $400 | $500+ | $150 | Can be strict on rate caps for certain projects. |
| **Coleman** | $300 - $500 | $850+ | $200 | Good rates for "big experts". |
| **Atheneum** | $300 - $500 | - | - | Slower payments reported; rates competitive for SaaS/Fintech. |

**Key Takeaway:** Never accept the default rate. Most platforms take a massive margin (charging clients $1,000+), so there is almost always room to negotiate up to at least $300-$500/hr.

## 2. The "Feast or Famine" Reality

*   **Project Frequency:** Consistency is the #1 complaint. You might get 3 calls in one week and then silence for two months.
*   **Volume Leaders:** GLG and Guidepoint generally have the highest volume of projects, but also the most competition.
*   **Niche is King:** Generalist profiles get few hits. Highly specific titles (e.g., "Former VP of Supply Chain at [Specific Competitor]") get constant requests.

## 3. Common Complaints & Red Flags

### 🚩 Unpaid Work (Screening)
*   **The Issue:** GLG and others are notorious for long "screening surveys" that ask for detailed info.
*   **User Quote:** *"I spent 20 minutes answering 'screening' questions that basically gave them the answer, and then never got booked."*
*   **Advice:** Keep screening answers high-level. Prove you *know* the answer, don't *give* the answer.

### 🚩 Cancellation Issues
*   **AlphaSights:** Multiple reports of calls being cancelled last-minute or even *during* the call without full payment.
*   **Guidepoint:** Some users reported having to "chase" payments or receiving less than agreed due to call duration disputes.

### 🚩 Compliance Burden
*   **The Issue:** Mandatory compliance training before every project can be tedious (15-20 mins unpaid).
*   **Strictness:** GLG is very strict on compliance. One slip-up (mentioning non-public info) can get you banned.

## 4. Platform-Specific Spotlights

### GLG (Gerson Lehrman Group)
*   **Pros:** Highest volume, prestigious clients, automated systems.
*   **Cons:** impersonal, high competition, unpaid surveys, annual cap (sometimes $5k) before employer consent is triggered.
*   **Verdict:** Must-have, but treat it transactionally.

### AlphaSights
*   **Pros:** fast matching, energetic associates.
*   **Cons:** aggressive scheduling, sometimes pushy, "bait and switch" on rates reported.
*   **Verdict:** Good for quick hits, be firm on rates.

### Tegus
*   **Pros:** High rates, modern platform, often pays for "asynchronous" work (answering questions in writing).
*   **Cons:** Content is archived/shared (your insights become a commodity for their subscribers), limiting repeat calls on the exact same topic.
*   **Verdict:** Best for high hourly rate maximization if you don't mind the "library" model.

## 5. Tips for Maximizing Earnings

1.  **The "Keyword Stuffing" Strategy:** Recruiters search by keywords. If you used "Salesforce", also list "CRM", "Cloud Computing", "SaaS", "Enterprise Software".
2.  **Responsiveness Speed Run:** The first 3 experts to reply usually get the slot. Reply to emails within 5 minutes.
3.  **The "Double" Rule:** Whatever their initial offer is, ask for double. If they offer $200, ask for $400. They will usually meet you at $300.
4.  **Don't ignore the "Aggregators":** Sign up for **Inex One**. It lets you manage profiles for multiple smaller networks in one place, saving admin time.
5.  **LLC Advantage:** If you break $5k/year, set up an LLC. It makes you look more professional and helps with tax deductions.

## 6. Summary Verdict
*   **Best for Volume:** GLG
*   **Best for Rates:** Tegus / AlphaSights (if negotiated)
*   **Best for Niche/Tech:** Tegus / Third Bridge
*   **Most Frustrating:** Guidepoint (payment friction), GLG (unpaid surveys)
