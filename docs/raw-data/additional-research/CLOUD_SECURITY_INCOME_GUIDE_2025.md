## 6. Action Plan for 2025

1.  **Get the AWS Security Specialty:** It is statistically the highest-ROI move you can make right now.
2.  **Pick a Platform Lane:** Don't be a generalist yet. Deep dive into **Azure Security** (for corporate/enterprise consulting) or **AWS Security** (for tech/SaaS consulting).
3.  **Formalize a Business:** If consulting, form an LLC to qualify for Partner Programs.
4.  **Package a "Product":** Create a standard "Security Assessment" scope of work to sell repeatedly, rather than custom quoting every hour.
