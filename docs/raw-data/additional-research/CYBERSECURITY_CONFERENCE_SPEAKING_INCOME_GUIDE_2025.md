## Strategy for Maximizing Income

### The "Freemium" Model
Most successful security consultants use the **Talk -> Training** funnel:
1.  **Give a killer talk (for free)** at a major conference (Black Hat/DEF CON). This establishes authority.
2.  **Offer a paid training** at the same event or privately.
3.  **Consulting upsell:** Use the talk to generate leads for high-ticket consulting engagements ($200/hr - $500/hr+).

### Keynote Fees (General Market)
If you establish yourself as a thought leader (book author, major research findings), you can charge for corporate speaking:
*   **Breakout Session:** $1,500 - $5,000
*   **Virtual Keynote:** $2,500 - $7,500
*   **In-Person Keynote (Tier 3 - Industry Expert):** $5,000 - $10,000
*   **In-Person Keynote (Tier 2 - Bestselling Author/CISO):** $15,000 - $30,000
*   **In-Person Keynote (Tier 1 - Celebrity):** $50,000+

## 2025 Trends
*   **Niche Workshops:** High demand for specialized training in **AI Security**, **Smart Contract Auditing**, and **ICS/OT Security**.
*   **Private Training:** Companies are increasingly hiring instructors directly for internal "bootcamps" to save on conference travel costs. Rates: **$3k - $6k per day** + expenses.
