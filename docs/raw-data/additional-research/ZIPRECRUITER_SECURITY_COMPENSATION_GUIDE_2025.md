**Key Insight:** Top 10 cities show only **7% variance**, indicating geographic arbitrage opportunities are limited for remote workers.

### 6.2 Senior Cyber Security Consultant - Top Cities

| City                 | Annual Range (25th - 90th) |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Frankston, TX**    | $123,813 - $223,920        |
| **Nome, AK**         | $123,500 - $223,200        |

| **National Average** | $99,500 - $180,000         |

### 6.3 Penetration Tester - Geographic Analysis

**Top-Paying Cities:**

| City                  | Annual Salary | % Above National |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Felton, CA**        | $152,420      | +27.1%           |
| **Williamsville, IL** | $149,942      | +25.0%           |
| **Corte Madera, CA**  | $148,942      | +24.2%           |

| **National Average**     | $119,895      | -                |

### 6.4 Cost of Living Considerations

**Analysis:** While top-paying cities offer 20-27% higher salaries, many are in high-cost-of-living areas (San Francisco Bay Area, Alaska). The limited variance (7%) between top cities suggests that location arbitrage opportunities are minimal for remote cybersecurity consultants.

**Best Value Propositions:**

- Remote work from lower cost-of-living states while earning top-tier salaries
- Positions in Washington state (no state income tax, 13% premium)
- Texas markets (no state income tax, near-national average pay)

| **Cyber Security Analyst**    | $120,000    | $126,975   | +5.8%   |

**Key Findings:**

- Remote CISOs command significantly higher compensation (36% premium)
- Remote consultants maintain parity with on-site positions
- Geographic salary variance limited to 7% among top-paying cities
- Remote work enables access to high-paying markets without relocation costs

### 7.5 Remote Work Best Practices for Compensation

1. **Negotiate based on market value, not location:** Remote positions increasingly pay market rate rather than location-adjusted rates
2. **Target companies in high-pay states:** NY, CA, WA companies often pay higher even for remote roles
3. **Emphasize specialized skills:** Cloud security, zero trust, compliance (GDPR, SOC 2) command premiums
4. **Consider tax implications:** Living in no-income-tax states (TX, FL, WA, NV) while earning top-tier remote salaries maximizes take-home pay

- Your specialized skills command premium rates (pen testing, cloud security)
- You value flexibility over benefits
- You're in CISO-level position (36% premium for remote/freelance)
- You have strong personal brand/network for client acquisition

**Choose Full-Time When:**

- You're early/mid-career building foundational experience
- You prefer single employer relationship
- Geographic location limits contract opportunities
- You value structured career progression

### 8.7 2025 Market Observations

**Supply & Demand Indicators:**

- 34,655 contract cybersecurity consultant jobs available (high demand)
- 439 freelance-specific positions (growing market)
- Wide pay ranges (up to 147% variance) indicate skills shortage
- Entry-level penetration testers earn more than mid-level consultants (critical shortage)

**Emerging Trends:**

- Remote CISO positions pay 36% more than traditional CISO roles
- Virtual/fractional CISO model growing (lower hourly rates but multiple clients)
- Geographic pay compression for remote roles (only 7% variance in top cities)
- Contractor/freelance premiums minimal except at executive level

**Red Flags:**

- "Security Contractor" roles often refer to physical security ($54k avg)
- "Virtual CISO" hourly rates much lower than expected (fractional/part-time)
- ZipRecruiter shows identical entry/senior pen tester data (data quality issue)

### 8.8 Negotiation Insights

**Leverage Points for Higher Compensation:**

1. **Location Arbitrage:** Remote role from high-paying state company while living in low-cost area
2. **Specialized Skills:** Cloud security, zero trust, compliance expertise
3. **Certifications:** CISSP, OSCP, CISM demonstrably increase offers
4. **Experience Level:** 26% premium from mid to senior consultant level
5. **Work Arrangement:** Remote CISO positions pay 36% more than office-based
6. **Multiple Offers:** Wide pay ranges indicate negotiation opportunity
7. **Title Specificity:** "Chief Information Security Officer" pays 36% more than "CISO"

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

- "Security Contractor" roles without "Cyber" specification (likely physical security)
- Below 25th percentile offers ($99,500 for consultants, $96,000 for pen testers)
- Virtual CISO roles at <$50/hour (fractional work, not full-time equivalent)

- Experience level breakdowns (entry, mid, senior)
- Job market availability (number of active postings)

### ZipRecruiter Methodology

According to ZipRecruiter:

- Salary estimates (ZipEstimate) derived from employer job postings and third-party data sources
- Data updated regularly based on live job market postings
- Estimates not verified by employers; actual compensation can vary
- Ranges reflect current job postings and salary survey data

### Data Limitations

1. **Self-Reported Bias:** Some data derived from job postings which may not reflect actual paid salaries
2. **Geographic Clustering:** High-paying cities concentrated in high-cost-of-living areas
3. **Experience Conflation:** Some roles (pen tester) show identical entry/senior ranges (data quality issue)
4. **Title Ambiguity:** "Security Contractor" includes physical security roles ($54k avg) vs. cybersecurity ($132k avg)
5. **Sample Size:** Not all locations/roles have sufficient data for statistical significance

### Recommendations for Job Seekers

When using this data:

1. **Cross-reference with other sources** (Glassdoor, PayScale, LinkedIn Salary)
2. **Consider total compensation** (benefits, equity, bonuses) not just base salary
3. **Adjust for cost of living** when comparing geographic locations
4. **Negotiate based on skills** not just years of experience
5. **Verify role scope** - ensure "security contractor" roles are cybersecurity, not physical security
