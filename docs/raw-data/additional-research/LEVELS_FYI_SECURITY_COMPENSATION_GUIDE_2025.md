## 1. Executive Summary: The 2025 Security Compensation Landscape

In 2025, cybersecurity remains one of the highest-paid engineering specializations. Compensation packages have stabilized following the volatility of previous years, with "Total Compensation" (TC) heavily weighted towards stock grants (RSUs) at top-tier tech companies.

**Key Findings:**
*   **Top Tier Standard:** A Senior Security Engineer at a FAANG company now commands a TC of **$400k - $450k+**.
*   **AppSec Premium:** Application Security Engineers continue to see a premium due to the shift-left movement, with senior individual contributors (ICs) clearing **$250k** easily.
*   **CISO Variance:** The CISO role has the highest variance, ranging from **$150k** at smaller firms to **$900k+** at large enterprises.

## 2. FAANG Security Engineer Compensation

The "Big Tech" cohort remains the benchmark for security compensation. Figures below represent Total Compensation (Base Salary + Bonus + Stock/RSUs).

### 🟢 Google (Alphabet)
*   **Average Security Engineer TC:** ~$318,000
*   **Senior Security Engineer TC:** ~$427,000
*   **L4 (Mid-Level) Projection:** ~$285,000
*   **L6 (Staff/Senior) Projection:** ~$426,000+
*   **Notes:** Google offers consistent RSU refreshes and top-tier benefits. L6+ roles often exceed $500k depending on stock performance.

### 🟠 Amazon (AWS/Retail)
*   **Average Security Engineer TC:** ~$276,000
*   **Entry-Level (L4) TC:** ~$186,000
*   **Senior Security Engineer (L6) TC:** ~$432,000
*   **Range:** $225k - $607k
*   **Notes:** Amazon compensation is heavily back-weighted with stock vesting schedules (5/15/40/40 split), meaning year 3 and 4 are the highest earners.

### 🍎 Apple
*   **Average Security Engineer TC:** ~$345,000
*   **Range:** $322,000 - $640,000
*   **Notes:** Apple grants RSUs that vest over time. The "Golden Handcuffs" are strong here, with significant retention bonuses for critical security talent (e.g., OS security, silicon security).

### 🔵 Meta (Facebook)
*   **Average Security Engineer TC:** ~$434,000 (Top-tier estimate)
*   **Base Salary:** ~$156,000+ (Base only)
*   **Notes:** Meta is known for having some of the highest initial grant offers in the industry to attract top talent quickly.

### 🔴 Netflix
*   **Senior Software Engineer (Security Proxy) TC:** ~$329,000 - $500,000+
*   **Notes:** Netflix is unique in offering "all-cash" compensation packages if the employee chooses, or a high mix of options. They famously pay top-of-market for Senior+ talent only.

## 3. Application Security (AppSec) Compensation

AppSec is a critical niche. These engineers bridge the gap between DevOps and Security.

*   **Average TC (All Levels):** ~$219,000
*   **Entry-Level AppSec:** ~$132,000 - $160,000
*   **Senior AppSec Engineer:** ~$259,000 (Range: $185k - $719k)
*   **Top 1% Percentile:** ~$756,000 (Principal/Distinguished level at top tech firms)

**Why the premium?**
AppSec engineers must know how to *code* as well as they know how to *break* code. This dual skillset is rarer than general infrastructure security skills.

## 4. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Compensation

CISO compensation is unstructured and highly negotiated. It depends heavily on company size, industry risk profile, and location.

### Compensation Tiers
*   **Tier 1 (Fortune 500 / Big Tech):**
    *   **Total Comp:** $500,000 - $900,000+
    *   **Structure:** High equity component, performance bonuses based on security posture and incident avoidance.
*   **Tier 2 (Mid-Market / Tech Unicorns):**
    *   **Total Comp:** $300,000 - $500,000
    *   **Structure:** Competitive base ($250k+) with significant upside if the company exits (IPO/Acquisition).
*   **Tier 3 (Small/Medium Enterprise):**
    *   **Total Comp:** $150,000 - $250,000
    *   **Structure:** Mostly base salary with standard benefits.

### Influencing Factors
*   **Location:** San Jose and SF Bay Area CISOs earn ~30-50% more than the national average.
*   **Sector:** Finance (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs) and Tech (Google, Microsoft) pay the most. Retail and Healthcare generally pay less, though this is shifting due to ransomware risks.

## 5. Highest Paying Companies for Security (2025)

Beyond FAANG, these companies are aggressively hiring and paying top dollar for security talent:

1.  **NVIDIA:** (AI Security focus, massive stock growth impact)
2.  **OpenAI:** (AI Safety and Security, top-tier engineering rates)
3.  **Databricks / Snowflake:** (Data Security, high pre/post-IPO equity value)
4.  **Coinbase:** (Crypto/Web3 Security, historically high cash/equity mix)
5.  **Palo Alto Networks / CrowdStrike:** (Security Product companies often pay well for internal security and research roles)
6.  **Hedge Funds (Two Sigma, Citadel):** (Extremely high cash compensation, often exceeding tech TC).

## 6. Negotiation Tips for 2025

*   **Focus on TC, not Base:** For L5+ roles, stock is 50% of your money. Negotiate the grant.
*   **Competing Offers:** You *must* have a competing offer to move the needle at FAANG.
*   **Sign-on Bonuses:** Use these to bridge the gap in Year 1 if stock vesting is back-loaded (like Amazon).
