## 3. Physical Security Assessment Rates

This is the core product for most consultants. Pricing represents the highest variability based on facility size and complexity.

### Project-Based Pricing
*   **Small Facility (Office/Retail):** $3,600 - $7,500
*   **Medium Facility (Warehouse/School):** $7,500 - $15,000

### Square Footage Pricing Model
Some consultants utilize a per-square-foot model for large commercial spaces:

*   **Example:** A 100,000 sq. ft. warehouse assessment could range from **$35,000 to $125,000** depending on the depth of the audit (e.g., including penetration testing or detailed engineering reviews).

### Deliverables Impacting Price
*   **Basic:** Walkthrough + Checklist Report.
*   **Standard:** Threat Vulnerability Risk Assessment (TVRA) + Photos + Recommendations.
*   **Premium:** All of the above + Engineering Design (CAD overlays) + Policy Review + Staff Interview + Social Engineering Testing.

## 4. Access Control System Consulting

This sector straddles "Consulting" and "Implementation/Engineering."

### System Design & Specification Fees
*   **Per-Door Installation Cost (Reference):** $2,500 - $4,300 per door (Commercial average).
*   **Consulting Fee:** Typically **10% - 20%** of the total project hardware/installation cost if managing the RFP and vendor selection.
    *   *Example:* For a 50-door office project ($150k value), a consultant might charge **$15k - $30k** to design the specs and oversee the integrator.

### Cloud/SaaS Models
*   **Recurring Revenue:** Consultants reselling or managing cloud access control (e.g., Kisi, Brivo) may earn commissions or markups on the **$3.50 - $15.00 per door/month** SaaS fees.

### GSA Schedule & Federal Consulting
*   **GSA Schedule Acquisition:** Consultants helping security firms get on GSA Schedule (e.g., 54151HACS or 84) charge **$6,000 - $25,000** per project.
*   **Maintenance Retainer:** $1,250 - $3,000/month to keep a client's GSA schedule compliant.

## 5. CPTED Consulting (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design)

CPTED is a specialized, high-value niche often mandated by city planning or insurance requirements.

### Rates & Fees
*   **Standard Assessment:** $2,500 - $10,000 per property.
*   **Hourly Rate:** $150 - $300 (Often higher due to specialized certification).
*   **Retainers:** ~$2,500 (approx. 8-10 hours block) for ongoing advisory during construction phases.

### Multi-Family Residential (Apartments/Condos)
*   **Initial Certification:** ~$15 per unit (Min $400).
*   **Annual Renewal:** ~$30 per unit (Min $600).
*   **Re-assessment:** ~$10 per unit.
*   *Strategy:* Secure contracts with property management companies for entire portfolios of apartment complexes.

## 6. Strategic Income Maximizers

To move from the lower end ($50/hr) to the higher end ($300/hr), the following are critical:

1.  **Certifications:**
    *   **CPP (Certified Protection Professional):** The "Gold Standard" by ASIS International.
    *   **PSP (Physical Security Professional):** Focuses on assessments and systems.
    *   **CPTED Professional Designation (CPD):** Essential for environmental design consulting.

2.  **Niche Specialization:**
    *   **Healthcare:** Compliance (HIPAA physical safeguards/Joint Commission) drives high fees.
    *   **Cannabis:** strict state regulations require expensive, mandatory security plans for licensing.
    *   **Data Centers:** High-stakes physical security convergence with cybersecurity.

3.  **The "Cyber-Physical" Bridge:**
    *   Consultants who can assess *both* the door lock (physical) and the reader's firmware vulnerability (cyber) command the highest premiums. This is the sweet spot for a cybersecurity professional entering the physical domain.

## 7. Conclusion

The physical security consulting market is robust. For a solo consultant, a realistic target revenue model involves:
*   **12 Assessments/Year** (1 per month @ $7,500 avg) = $90,000
*   **2 Major Design Projects** (@ $25,000 avg) = $50,000
*   **Retainer/Advisory** (10 hrs/mo @ $200/hr) = $24,000
*   **Total Gross Income:** **~$164,000**

With CPTED specialization or high-end critical infrastructure assessments, this can easily exceed **$250,000**.
