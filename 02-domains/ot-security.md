# OT/ICS Industrial Security Consulting — 10K Research Dossier

**Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive, vendor-aware research briefing for OT/ICS industrial security consulting, with a focus on Claroty, Nozomi Networks, and Dragos. Includes market landscape, service models, typical deliverables, rate benchmarks, and practical guidance for consulting engagements.

**Scope**: Critical infrastructure and industrial environments (manufacturing, energy, oil & gas, utilities, water/wastewater, transportation, chemicals, food & beverage, pharmaceuticals, mining, and discrete manufacturing). Covers OT/ICS, IT/OT convergence, and industrial IoT security.

**Method**: Synthesized from industry best practices, common vendor professional services patterns, and typical enterprise procurement models. Rates are **indicative ranges** and should be validated via vendor quotes or partner proposals.

## 1) Executive Summary

Industrial cybersecurity consulting is transitioning from ad‑hoc assessments to long‑term, outcome‑based programs that combine asset visibility, segmentation, detection, and incident readiness. Enterprises increasingly adopt a “controls‑first” program model that begins with asset inventory and risk quantification, then evolves into network segmentation, OT SOC integration, and mature incident response.

Three dominant specialist vendors—Claroty, Nozomi Networks, and Dragos—anchor many OT/ICS programs. They offer adjacent software platforms and professional services, often delivered in collaboration with GSIs, regional MSSPs, or boutique OT consultancies. Pricing structures typically blend fixed‑fee assessments with time‑and‑materials implementation.

Key takeaways:

- **Demand drivers**: IT/OT convergence, ransomware targeting industrial operations, regulatory oversight, and supply chain pressure.
- **Most common entry points**: Asset discovery and network visibility, followed by risk assessments and segmentation planning.
- **Value hinge**: Deliverables that translate technical risk into operational impact, enabling leadership to prioritize remediation.
- **Rate realities**: OT/ICS consulting commands premium rates due to scarce talent, operational risk, and specialized tooling. Expect broad bands by region and specialization.

## 2) OT/ICS Threat Landscape

Industrial environments are uniquely exposed to targeted disruption and safety risks. Unlike enterprise IT, OT emphasizes availability, integrity, and safety; security controls must protect operations without disrupting process control.

### Common Threat Vectors

- **Ransomware with operational impact**: IT compromise cascading into OT shutdowns.
- **Credential misuse**: Shared engineering accounts, weak remote access controls.
- **Legacy protocol exploitation**: Modbus, DNP3, PROFINET, Ethernet/IP with limited security controls.
- **Supply chain and contractor access**: Vendor laptops, third‑party remote support portals.
- **Misconfiguration and unpatched systems**: Hard‑to‑patch PLCs, HMIs, and historians.

### Operational Consequences

- Safety events and environmental harm
- Downtime and production loss
- Regulatory enforcement and fines
- Brand and supply chain disruption
