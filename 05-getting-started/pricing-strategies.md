## Executive Summary: Pricing Reality Check
- Security consulting rates in repo research span roughly $40/hour (entry platform work) to $1,000+/hour (expert networks and expert witness).
- Average freelance cybersecurity consulting rate appears near $144/hour in internal datasets.
- U.S. employee-equivalent averages cluster around $50-$70/hour, reinforcing the need for 1099 premiums.
- Premium expert networks commonly list $300-$1,000/hour for advisory calls.
- vCISO models dominate recurring revenue, with $2k-$25k/month retainers depending on scope and seniority.
- Fixed-fee compliance and pentest packages often outperform hourly billing when scope is tight.
- Toptal, Upwork, and Fiverr show clear fee drag; net-rate math is mandatory for margin protection.
- Retainer + project hybrid is the most stable model cited across repo guides.
- Incident response and DFIR work command the highest urgency premiums and require strict minimums.
- Expert witness work requires upfront retainers and minimum billing blocks.
- Specialty premiums are consistently higher for OT/ICS, AI security, cloud, and zero trust architecture.
- Day-rate anchors across multiple sources cluster at $1,000-$3,000/day for senior work.
- High-end contractor signals ($200-$700/hour) often reflect emergency or expert-call engagements, not staff augmentation.
- Rate negotiation advice repeats: start 15-20% above target, set floors, and anchor with outcome value.
- Annual rate increases of 5-10% are recommended as a baseline; larger jumps after certifications or scarcity.
- Platform-driven rate compression is common; direct B2B work supports $200+/hour for specialists.
- Bundled packages and productized offers improve conversion and defend premium pricing.
- Scope discipline and change orders are critical to preserving effective hourly rate.
- Retainer conversion is the primary path to predictable cash flow.
- Payment terms should target Net 15/Net 30; avoid Net 60+.

## Pricing Model Map (When to Use Which)

### Hourly / Time & Materials
- Best for ambiguous scope, emergency response, or ongoing advisory with variable effort.
- Typical ranges in repo data: $75-$300/hour general, $200-$500/hour for vCISO, $100-$300/hour for pentest.
- Use minimum blocks (2-4 hours) to prevent micro-billing.
- Protects against scope creep but caps upside on high-impact work.
- Combine with weekly caps or sprint scopes for predictability.

### Daily / Weekly
- Common in pentest, architecture, and staff augmentation engagements.
- Day-rate anchors: $1,000-$2,500/day for senior pentest; $1,500-$3,000+ for enterprise consulting.
- Simplifies client procurement for 1-3 week sprints.
- Works well for on-site or workshop-heavy work.
- Blend with fixed-fee reporting to protect margin.

### Fixed-Fee Projects
- Best for discrete deliverables (pentest report, SOC 2 readiness, architecture review).
- Typical project bands: $5k-$100k+ depending on scope, with 10-25% contingency.
- Requires detailed scoping and explicit change-order terms.
- Offers upside when delivery efficiency is high.
- Add paid retest or remediation support to avoid unpaid rework.

### Retainers (Monthly / Quarterly)
- Best for ongoing leadership, continuous monitoring, or program management.
- vCISO retainers commonly $2k-$25k/month; DFIR retainers include prepaid hours.
- Provides predictable cash flow and deeper client integration.
- Include explicit SLA, meeting cadence, and deliverables per month.
- Track unused hours and roll into tabletop exercises or roadmap updates.

### Value-Based / Outcome-Based
- Price tied to business impact (audit readiness, risk reduction, revenue enablement).
- Works well for compliance readiness, M&A due diligence, and transformation programs.
- Requires quantified outcomes and a defined success metric.
- Often paired with fixed-fee + bonus for milestone attainment.
- Use a value-capture ratio (e.g., 10-30% of quantified value).

### Hybrid Models
- Most common model in repo guidance: retainer + project add-ons.
- Example: $7.5k/month vCISO + $15k SOC 2 readiness project.
- Use hourly out-of-scope adders to prevent margin erosion.
- Ideal for long-term accounts with periodic large deliverables.
- Requires a clear boundary between retainer scope and project scope.

## Value-Based Pricing Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Value Driver
- Compliance deadline avoidance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA).
- Cost-of-breach reduction (average breach costs used as anchor).
- Revenue enablement (closing enterprise deals or procurement clearance).
- Operational savings (reduced manual security overhead).

### Step 2: Quantify Impact
- Estimate avoided breach cost, audit delay costs, or lost deal revenue.
- Use conservative ranges to maintain credibility.
- Translate time savings into internal labor cost reduction.

### Step 3: Define the Outcome
- Example: “SOC 2 Type 1 readiness in 6 weeks.”
- Example: “Reduce critical findings by 70% within 90 days.”
- Example: “Zero trust architecture approved by security council.”

### Step 4: Apply a Value Capture Ratio
- Typical capture ratio: 10-30% of quantified value.
- Higher ratios justified for urgent or scarce expertise.
- Lower ratios for commoditized or repeatable work.

### Step 5: Package the Offer
- Convert into a fixed-fee or hybrid proposal.
- Include milestones with payment triggers.
- Attach a premium retainer for ongoing governance.

### Value-Based Guardrails
- Anchor with a baseline T&M estimate, then show the outcome premium.
- Require discovery phase before committing to outcomes.
- Use success criteria that are measurable and auditable.

---

## Rate Negotiation Playbook

### Pre-Negotiation Setup
- Research specialization bands and local market ranges.
- Determine your floor rate using 1099 premium math.
- Define non-negotiables (minimum hours, payment terms, response SLAs).
- Prepare 2-3 comparables (platform data, expert network bands).

### Anchoring Tactics
- Start 15-20% above target to allow negotiation room.
- Lead with outcomes and specialization scarcity.
- Use tiered offers to prevent price-only comparison.

### Concession Strategy
- Trade scope for price, not price for scope.
- Offer schedule flexibility in exchange for rate retention.
- Provide a limited-time discount tied to a retainer commitment.

### Defensive Pricing Moves
- Add rush multipliers (1.5-2x) for urgent or weekend work.
- Apply minimum engagement sizes (20-40 hours or 1-month retainer).
- Use milestone payments to reduce risk and accelerate cash flow.

### Closing the Deal
- Summarize value achieved, not hours delivered.
- Reinforce that higher rates buy experienced delivery and lower risk.
- Confirm payment terms and change-order process in writing.

---

## Rate Calculation & Fee Math

### Salary-to-Hourly Conversion
- Base hourly = Annual salary / 2,080 hours.
- Example: $150k salary ≈ $72/hour base.

### 1099 Premium Formula
- 1099 hourly floor = base hourly × 1.3 to 1.4.
- Rule of thumb: 173% of W-2 hourly rate.

### Utilization Adjustment
- Loaded cost = base salary × (1 + overhead) / 2,080.
- Billable rate = loaded cost / utilization.
- Target price = billable rate × (1 + margin).

### Platform Net Rate Math
- Net rate = Gross rate × (1 - platform fee).
- Upwork: gross $100 → net $90 (10% fee).
- Fiverr: gross $125 → net $100 (20% fee).

### Retainer Pricing Math
- Retainer = hourly anchor × reserved hours × 0.8-0.9 (commitment discount).
- Add SLA premium for priority response.
