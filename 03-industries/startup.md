# MASSIVE 10K RESOURCE RESEARCH: Cybersecurity Startup Consulting (Security Advisor Equity + Startup CISO Compensation)

**Compiled:** 2025-12-24  
**Scope:** Startup security consulting economics, advisor equity frameworks, and startup CISO compensation benchmarks.  
**Data note:** This guide is synthesized from local research files in this repo; no live web browsing was performed. Local sources emphasize equity importance but rarely quantify advisor equity percentages, so equity bands below are heuristic ranges meant for planning and negotiation.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **Startup CISO base range:** Early-stage startup CISOs typically sit around **$160k–$210k base + equity**, while mid-market to growth-stage companies trend **$230k–$330k cash** with higher total comp potential.
- **Total comp by revenue (IANS benchmarks):** Under $50M revenue **$260k total** ($230k cash), $50M–$200M **$330k total** ($280k cash), $200M–$600M **$365k total** ($310k cash), $600M–$1B+ **$415k+ total** ($350k+ cash).
- **Compensation tiers (Levels-style):** Tier 3 SMBs **$150k–$250k**, Tier 2 mid‑market/unicorns **$300k–$500k**, Tier 1 big tech **$500k–$900k+** total comp with heavy equity weight.
- **Equity impact:** Local salary research notes equity can **double base salary** in top-tier packages and that **equity/LTI should be ~20%–40% of total comp** for executive‑level security leaders.
- **Full-time vs fractional:** vCISO cost savings are consistently **60%–75%** vs full‑time CISO total compensation. Typical vCISO pricing spans **$150–$500/hr** and **$2k–$25k/month** retainers, making fractional leadership the default for many startups.
- **Advisor equity reality:** Advisors are rarely paid market cash; equity is used to close the gap. Equity is most defensible when paired with concrete deliverables (security roadmap, risk ownership, compliance readiness).
- **Negotiation anchor:** Treat the **full‑time CISO total cost** and **market consulting rates** as anchors, then back into a cash + equity mix that reflects time, risk, and accountability.

## 3. Startup Security Consulting Landscape

Startups adopt security consulting earlier in their lifecycle than ever before. Primary drivers in the local research corpus include:

- **Enterprise sales pressure:** SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI, and customer security questionnaires are required even at seed/Series A.
- **Board/investor scrutiny:** Security posture now impacts valuation and fundraising timelines.
- **Regulatory expansion:** SEC disclosure rules, state privacy laws, and industry mandates are pushing earlier security leadership hiring.
- **CISO burnout + short tenure:** Average tenure is **18–26 months** and **62%** of CISOs report burnout, accelerating demand for fractional leadership.
- **Cost sensitivity:** Startups often cannot justify $300k–$500k+ total CISO cost, so they use fractional or advisory models to defer full-time hires.

**Fortune 500 reference:** Median **$584,000 cash** (excluding equity) for the largest enterprises.

### 4.3 Startup Stage Mapping (Derived from Revenue Bands)

| Stage | Typical Revenue Band | CISO Cash Range | Equity Expectation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-Seed / Seed | Pre-revenue to <$5M | $160k–$210k base | Equity-heavy, lower cash |
| Series A | ~$5M–$25M | $200k–$250k cash | Meaningful options, higher risk |

| Series C+ / Pre-IPO | $50M+ | $280k–$350k+ cash | Equity + bonus heavier |

**Note:** Stage mapping is heuristic; revenue and headcount vary widely by sector.

### 4.4 Total Compensation Structure (Cash + Equity)

- **Equity dominance at the top:** Local salary research notes equity can **double base salary** in top-tier CISO packages.
- **Executive mix target:** Equity/LTI should typically represent **20%–40%** of total comp for executive-level security leaders.
- **Tiered equity weights:**
  - Tier 1 (big tech / mega-cap): High equity and performance bonuses.
  - Tier 2 (unicorns / mid-market tech): Base often **$250k+** with meaningful upside on exit.
  - Tier 3 (SMB/startup): Lower base, higher equity sensitivity.

### 4.5 Geographic & Industry Modifiers

- **Top markets:** San Jose, San Francisco, NYC, DC, and Seattle command 30%–100% premiums.
- **Industry premiums:** Finance, tech, and regulated sectors (healthcare) pay 25%–50% more.
- **Startups vs enterprises:** Startups consistently trade lower base for equity upside (“lower base + equity”).

### 4.6 Full-Time vs Fractional CISO Economics

| Model | Typical Range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-time CISO | $200k–$500k+ total comp | 6-month hiring timeline, benefits, recruiting cost | 
| Fractional/vCISO hourly | $150–$500/hr | $200–$300/hr typical, $500+ premium | 
| Fractional/vCISO retainer | $2k–$25k/month | $5k–$15k most common | 
| vCISO cost savings | 60%–75% | Market-wide benchmark | 

**Startup implication:** For many startups, a **10–20 hr/month fractional CISO** is the optimal early-stage entry point.

## 5. Security Advisor Equity Deep Dive

### 5.1 Advisor Role Archetypes

- **Lightweight Advisor (1–2 hrs/month):** Occasional strategy calls, intros, security posture review.
- **Active Advisor (2–6 hrs/month):** Security roadmap ownership, risk planning, compliance prep.
- **Fractional CISO (10–30 hrs/month):** Ongoing leadership, board reporting, compliance ownership.
- **Board/Committee Member:** Fiduciary role, governance oversight, potential liability exposure.

### 5.2 Equity Instruments Commonly Used

- **Stock options (NSO/ISO):** Most common advisor equity grant for private startups.
- **Restricted stock (early-stage):** Useful pre‑revenue for favorable tax treatment.
- **RSUs (late-stage):** More common as companies mature.
- **Advisor equity pools:** Separate from employee option pools, often 1%–2% of fully diluted equity.

### 5.3 Heuristic Equity Bands (Advisory Roles)

**These are planning bands only** and should be validated against stage, valuation, and scope.

| Stage | Lightweight Advisor | Active Advisor | Fractional CISO | Board/Committee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-Seed | 0.25%–0.75% | 0.5%–1.25% | 0.75%–2.0% | 0.5%–1.5% |
| Seed | 0.15%–0.50% | 0.25%–0.75% | 0.5%–1.5% | 0.25%–1.0% |
| Series A | 0.10%–0.30% | 0.20%–0.50% | 0.35%–1.0% | 0.15%–0.60% |
| Series B | 0.05%–0.20% | 0.10%–0.30% | 0.25%–0.75% | 0.10%–0.40% |
| Series C+ | 0.02%–0.10% | 0.05%–0.20% | 0.10%–0.40% | 0.05%–0.25% |

### 5.4 Equity vs Cash Trade-Off Logic

- **Anchor on market rate:** A fractional CISO at **$200–$300/hr** (typical market) sets the baseline cash equivalent.
- **Quantify the gap:** If the startup can only afford 50% of market cash, equity should compensate for the other 50%.
- **Example conversion:**
  - 8 hrs/month at $250/hr = $24,000/year cash value.
  - If cash offered is $12,000/year, the equity grant should target the remaining $12,000 in *expected value*.
  - Use realistic exit probabilities; equity is not guaranteed cash.

### 5.5 Vesting & Term Structure (Typical Patterns)

- **Vesting:** 2–4 years, monthly or quarterly vesting.
- **Cliff:** 3–12 months; advisors often use shorter cliffs than employees.
- **Acceleration:** Negotiable on acquisition or change‑of‑control.
- **Scope lock:** Equity should be tied to explicit deliverables and time commitments.

### 5.6 Dilution & Risk Reality

- **Dilution:** Expect 15%–30% dilution across future fundraising rounds.
- **Option pool refreshes:** Advisor equity can be diluted by pool expansions.
- **Exit risk:** Most equity outcomes are $0; treat equity as long-tail upside.

### 5.7 When to Prefer Cash Over Equity

- High time commitment (20+ hrs/month) with executive accountability.
- Regulatory exposure or breach liability.
- Short runway (<9 months) with uncertain fundraising.
- High operational workload (incident response, audits, customer escalations).

## 6. Startup Consulting Compensation Models

### 6.1 Pricing Structures (Local Benchmarks)

| Model | Typical Range | Best Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hourly | $150–$500/hr | Short advisory, incident response | 
| Monthly retainer | $2k–$25k/month | Ongoing leadership, roadmap delivery | 
| Project-based | $5k–$100k+ | SOC 2 readiness, gap assessments | 
| Annual package | $30k–$240k | Full security program ownership | 

### 6.2 Startup-Friendly Offer Design

- **Seed/Series A:** Security roadmap + foundational policies + vendor risk guidance.
- **Series B:** Compliance readiness (SOC 2/ISO) + incident response + security program KPIs.
- **Series C+:** Security governance, board reporting, and product security scaling.

### 6.3 Packaging Example (Seed-Stage)

- **Discovery + risk assessment:** $7.5k–$15k one-time.
- **Monthly retainer:** $3k–$7.5k for 8–15 hrs/month.
- **Equity add‑on:** 0.15%–0.50% to offset cash gap.

---

## 7. Scenario Models (Cash + Equity Blends)

### 7.1 Early-Stage Fractional CISO (Seed)

- **Scope:** 8–12 hrs/month, security roadmap, SOC 2 readiness planning.
- **Cash:** $2,500–$5,000/month.
- **Equity:** 0.25%–0.75% with 2–4 year vesting.
- **Rationale:** Startup can’t afford $200–$300/hr full market rate; equity bridges the gap.

### 7.2 Series A Full-Time CISO (Growth-Ready)

- **Cash base:** $200k–$250k.
- **Bonus:** 10%–20% tied to audit and risk milestones.
- **Equity:** 0.5%–1.0% (higher if the role is the first security exec).

### 7.3 Series B/C Full-Time CISO (Scale Stage)

- **Cash base:** $250k–$320k.
- **Bonus:** 15%–25% with compliance + incident KPIs.
- **Equity:** 0.25%–0.75% depending on valuation and stage.

### 7.4 Late-Stage / Pre‑IPO CISO

- **Total comp target:** $350k–$500k+ with high equity weighting.
- **Equity:** RSUs or options tied to IPO/exit milestones.

### 7.5 Advisor Portfolio Strategy

- **Portfolio approach:** 3–6 advisory roles at 2–4 hrs/month each.
- **Cash floor:** $1.5k–$4k/month per startup.
- **Equity targets:** 0.1%–0.5% per company (stage dependent).
- **Risk logic:** A portfolio diversifies the low probability of a single exit.
