## Income Reality Check

Based on extensive research across Reddit, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and direct platform data:

| Timeline | Solo Consultant           | With Firm        |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Year 1   | $8K-$20K/month            | $15K-$30K/month  |
| Year 2   | $25K-$40K/month           | $40K-$70K/month  |
| Year 3   | $40K-$60K/month           | $70K-$100K/month |
| Year 4+  | $60K-$80K/month (ceiling) | $100K+/month     |

**Key insight:** $100K/month as a solo consultant is extremely rare (top 0.01%). Most achieve it by building a boutique firm.
