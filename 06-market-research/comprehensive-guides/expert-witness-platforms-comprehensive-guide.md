1. **Certifications Front & Center**
   - CISSP, CEH, CFCE prominently displayed
   - Years of experience highlighted
   - Ongoing education demonstrated

2. **Specialty Niching**
   - Don't be generic "cybersecurity"
   - Examples: "Cloud security architecture", "Ransomware forensics", "BIPA compliance"
   - Narrow focus = higher rates

3. **Testimony Experience**
   - List case types (not case names due to confidentiality)
   - Federal vs. state court experience
   - Depositions vs. trial testimony
   - Expert report writing samples

4. **Publications & Recognition**
   - Journal articles
   - Conference presentations
   - Industry awards
   - Media appearances
   - Professional association leadership

5. **Active Practice Emphasis**
   - Current role and responsibilities
   - Hands-on technical work
   - Industry leadership position
   - Not retired (active = premium rates)

### Marketing Strategy

**Multi-Platform Approach:**

1. Sign up for ALL free platforms (no downside)
2. Select 1-2 paid platforms based on specialty
3. Trial paid platforms for 2 years minimum
4. Track ROI meticulously
5. Discontinue non-performing platforms

**SEO & Visibility:**

- Rush work: Base + 50-100%
