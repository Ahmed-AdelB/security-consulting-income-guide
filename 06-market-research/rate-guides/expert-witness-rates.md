## Rate Negotiation

### Setting Your Rate

**Calculation Method:**

```
1. Opportunity cost (your day rate if consulting): $3,000/day
2. Expertise premium for litigation: +50-100%
3. Liability/stress premium: +25%
4. Result: $4,500-$7,500/day = $560-$940/hr
```

### Negotiation Scripts

**Stating Your Rate:**

> "My standard rate for case review and consultation is $550/hour. Deposition testimony is $800/hour with a four-hour minimum, and trial testimony is $1,000/hour with an eight-hour minimum for each day I'm required in court."

**Handling Pushback:**

> "I understand law firms have budget constraints. However, my rates reflect 20 years of specialized experience and a track record of clear, compelling testimony. Underprepared expert testimony is ultimately more costly than investing in the right expert."

**Premium Cases:**

> "Given the complexity of this blockchain forensics matter and the $50M at stake, my rate for this engagement would be $750/hour. This reflects the specialized expertise required and my availability to prioritize this case."
