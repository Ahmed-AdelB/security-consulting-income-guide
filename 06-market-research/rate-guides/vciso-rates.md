## Rate Negotiation

### Setting Your Rate

1. **Calculate your floor:**
   - Target annual income / (hours per year available)
   - Example: $300,000 / 1,500 hours = $200/hr minimum

2. **Add overhead and profit:**
   - Insurance, tools, training: +15-20%
   - Profit margin: +20-30%
   - Result: $260-$300/hr target

3. **Adjust for market:**
   - Compare to platform rates
   - Consider your differentiators
   - Factor in competition

### Negotiation Scripts

**Initial Proposal:**

> "For a comprehensive vCISO engagement covering security program oversight, policy development, and compliance preparation, my standard retainer is $12,000/month for approximately 25 hours. This includes executive reporting, board presentations, and on-call availability during business hours."

**Handling Price Objections:**

> "I understand budget constraints. We could structure a smaller engagement starting at $6,000/month focused on [specific priority]. As you see value, we can expand the scope."

**Value Justification:**

> "The average cost of a data breach for companies your size is $3.9 million. My role is to reduce that risk significantly while ensuring you can close deals that require security attestation. Most clients see ROI within the first quarter when they close deals that required SOC 2."
