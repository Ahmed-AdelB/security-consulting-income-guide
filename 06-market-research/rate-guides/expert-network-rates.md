4. Decline gracefully if too low

### Rate Escalation Timeline

| Period     | Action                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Month 1-3  | Accept most opportunities to build profile |

| Month 7-12 | Increase another 15-20% based on demand    |
| Year 2+    | Premium positioning, selective acceptance  |

### Negotiation Scripts

**Setting Initial Rate:**

> "Based on my 15 years of experience in cloud security architecture and my work with Fortune 500 companies, my standard consulting rate is $500/hour. I'm flexible for ongoing relationships."

**Declining Low Offers:**

> "Thank you for thinking of me for this opportunity. My current rate for this type of consultation is $450/hour. I'd be happy to help if the budget allows for that rate in the future."

**Counter-offering:**

> "I appreciate the offer of $300/hour. Given the specialized nature of OT/ICS security and my background at [Major Utility], I typically consult at $500/hour. Would $450 work for this engagement?"
