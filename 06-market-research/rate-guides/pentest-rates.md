## Pricing Models

### Time & Materials (T&M)

**Best for:** Complex assessments, ongoing relationships

```
Daily rate x estimated days + expenses
Example: $2,500/day x 10 days = $25,000 + travel
```

**Pros:**

- Fair for scope changes
- Lower risk for consultant
- Flexibility

**Cons:**

- Client budget uncertainty
- May discourage efficiency

### Fixed Price

**Best for:** Well-defined scope, competitive bids

```
Scoped assessment at fixed price
Example: Web app pentest (5 pages, 3 roles) = $12,000
```

**Pros:**

- Client knows exact cost
- Rewards efficiency
- Easier to sell

**Cons:**

- Scope creep risk
- May underprice complex work

### Retainer Model

**Best for:** Ongoing security partnerships

```
Monthly retainer for X hours + reduced hourly overflow
Example: $8,000/month for 20 hours, $350/hr overtime
```

**Pros:**

- Predictable revenue
- Deeper client relationship
- Higher total value

**Cons:**

- Capacity management
- May underutilize hours

## Rate Negotiation

### Calculating Your Rate

```
1. Target annual income: $300,000
2. Available work days: 230 days/year
3. Utilization rate: 70% = 161 billable days
4. Required day rate: $300,000 / 161 = $1,863/day
5. Add 20% buffer: $2,236/day
6. Round to: $2,500/day or $312/hr
```

### Negotiation Tactics

**Anchoring High:**

> "Our standard rate for this type of assessment is $3,500/day. For a multi-engagement agreement, we can discuss volume discounts."

**Handling Price Pushback:**

> "I understand budget is a concern. We could reduce scope to focus on your most critical assets, which would bring the price to $X while still addressing your primary risks."

**Value Justification:**

> "Consider that a single exploitable vulnerability in production could cost $500K+ in breach response, regulatory fines, and reputation damage. Our assessment is an investment in prevention."

- **Payment terms:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
